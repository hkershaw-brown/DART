Prepare for making the reanalysis branch public.

These are the updates from the Reanalysis CASEROOT 
(/glade/work/raeder/Exp/f.e21.FHIST_BGC.f09_025.CAM6assim.011) 
merged with some upgrades in cam-fv/shell_scripts/cesm2_1.
There are additional helper scripts in CASEROOT,
but they're not general enough to be committed to DART.
Some of them are committed to DART_CASES.

A few others are not in shell_scripts.
Obs_diag.f90 is what was actually used, even though it may
not be what we settle on for the main branch; e.g. it has
the Bessel correction in the RMSE, and sets singleton obs'
RMSEs to missing_r8.
The others are incidental changes.

These have not been tested as a group, but were derived from
versions that were tested.  A comprehensive test is planned
after this push and the push of obs space diagnostic pieces
from Kevin's Mac.  The updated reanalysis branch on 
github:kdraeder/DART_development (reanalysis is the branch I'm on).
will be checked out and used to set up an OSSE for Zagar.
