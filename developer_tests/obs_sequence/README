obs_rwtest:

subroutine level test for reading both ascii and binary obs_seq files,
and testing the writing out.

there's a new option to open binary obs_seq files with
a specific endian-ness on read.

this still needs a main script to run multiple tests in
a semi-automated fashion.

you can do:  echo filein fileout | ./obs_rwtest
but if you want to change the obs_seq namelist to
set the read endianness you still have to do that
with a sed command on the input.nml.  i've run out
of energy on this - if anyone is inspired to try to
make a shell script to run some test cases, bravo.

run_seqtool_test:

shell script that runs the obs_sequence_tool with various input.nmls.
you need to build it in the work directory first before running it.
