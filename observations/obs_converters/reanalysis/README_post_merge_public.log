This is missing Nancy's cf9d8d5 from Sep 16,
despite my fetch of the "public" reanalysis branch and merge.

    Merge branch 'reanalysis' of github.com:NCAR/DART into reanalysis
    
    Trying to follow instructions.  Not hopeful.
    After the failed pull, I edited README to choose
    the versions of the conflicts I want to keep, and then
    git merge -s recursive -Xours reanalysis
    It failed, saying I needed to add and then commit the README.
    So that's what I'm doing.

    Update README for NCEP+ACARS+GPS+AIRS in reanalysis branch.
    
    + Updated to remove outdated instructions and add current
      procedures for getting and converting obs.
    + Added locations of scripts and programs in the new
      obs_converters/reanalysis directory (of the reanalysis branch).
    + Nancy plans to add descriptions of the data.
    + There are lots of white space changes to make the white space
      more consistent.  So use diffuse -b if you want to highlight
      the meaningful changes.

    add the monthly batch scripts for AIRS, fix a missing line in the README
    
    somehow a line got munged from the readme, and the airs scripts
    are in a separate directory and didn't get committed.
