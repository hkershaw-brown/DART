Hi Tim,

I'm trying to update my github:kdraeder/DART_development/reanalysis
from /glade (and then from my Mac) to prepare for making the branch public.
I'm on the reanalysis branch (on casper).
I made a bunch of changes to files, added them, so I had

$ git status -uno
# On branch reanalysis

I took your advice and did a fetch (dry run first, then the actual) 
and merge, intead of a pull.

I'm not inclined to keep pulling until I have some guidance that that's
actually the right thing to do.  What does it look like to you?
