#	            The usual (de)activated SYSTEM BLOCK
#	modified:   assimilation_code/programs/obs_diag/threed_sphere/obs_diag.f90
#	               ADDED
#	            Mine; updated 'source' info, missing_r4 > r8,
#	               Bessel correction,
#	               And it's what we used, so commit it
#	            Alternative version: obs_diag_grand+Kevin.f90
#	               Replaces missing value, which is assigned when there's just 1 ob,
#	               with an actual RMSE value, so that they will be included in the
#	               grand stats in the Matlab scripts.
#	               This will be even more justified if we get rid of the Bessel Correction.
#	modified:   build_templates/mkmf.template
#	            2020-2-19.  axavx -> xHost
#	               ADDED
#	modified:   models/cam-fv/matlab/gen_rean_diags.m
#	            Just comments, but the one I used is on my Mac:
#                   It lives in diagnostics/matlab (instead of cam-fv/matlab)
#                      which is where we decided it should be.
#                      Upgraded to use more flexible(?) path names, specifically
#                      not requiring results.m and obs_diag_output.nc to be in the same dir.
#                   No mv of pictures to obs_space_dir and tar
#                      tar is(was, when needed) in rsync_rean_diags_to_webpub.csh
#                   It's called by ~/Scripts/get_start.csh,
#                      which maybe should be included in the package.
#                   get_start.csh gets the obs_diag_output.nc (/glade or local),
#                      starts `matlab gen_rean_diags` and
#                      runs rsync_web to send the public pictures to the web page.
#                      This is run before I run my diagnostics in a My_Diags_NTRS directory.
#                      It runs rsync_web, which is
#                         cam-fv/shell_scripts/cesm2_1/rsync_rean_diags_to_webpub.csh
#                   rsync_rean_diags_to_webpub.csh
#                      optionally tars the .ps, .pdf and obs_diag_output.nc.
#                      rsyncs the .png files in web_ subdir to the /test/image/pub web site.
#                      Maybe should be included in the package.
#	modified:   models/cam-fv/matlab/plot_rmse_xxx_evolution.m
#	            Should be removed; on Mac version we handled this file in diagnostics/matlab
#	modified:   models/cam-fv/shell_scripts/cesm2_1/DART_config.template
#	               ADDED
#	            Removed version control lines,
#	            Simpler, more generic, BOGUS path name for setup scripts.
#	            This allows setup_advanced to provide the whole path name.
#	modified:   models/cam-fv/shell_scripts/cesm2_1/assimilate.csh.template
#	            Minor diff from HEAD, but notably different from $casename/assimilate.csh:
#	               Several are debugging the cheyenne upgrade problems; mpt, etc.
#	               Several more are debugging cycle time deceleration, commented out.
#	               2 are TODO comments.
#	               Moves only the member .i. files, not the {mean,sd} files to hidedir.
#	               Compress fewer files at the end
#                      
#	modified:   models/cam-fv/shell_scripts/cesm2_1/setup_advanced
#	               ADDED
#	            Provide whole path name to DART_config.template.
#	            Fixed typos, escaped ' in data_scripts.csh section
#	            Extensive comments about the SSTICE files' time of day
#	            and a check for the presence of 'avhrr' in $sst_dataset
#	            and a replacement of time 0 with 43200.
#	            ? this may not be the best solution.

#	                Did not have creation of data_scripts.csh
#	                did not have the 'center of day' SST time fix.
