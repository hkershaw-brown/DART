    The `globus endpoint activate --myproxy` was misleading.
    --myproxy can't work on batch nodes since it needs
    a username and password to be provided, either
    manually (not possible on batch nodes) or via hard-coding (insecure).
    So this script relies on auto-activation, which must be done manually
    before the script is run.

    Fixed handling of existing yearly history files.
    They were not found in the previous version
    due to having "TYPE" in the file name.
    
    Better exit numbering.

    Lots of fixes resulting from testing repack_st_archive.csh and purge.csh.
    This has been tested from setup through purge in a 3 member, 2 day test.
    These changes have not been reviewed by anyone.
    They are not entirely compliant with DART code conventions.
    
    launch_cf.sh
    > Running under slurm requires the use of a different task counter environment variable.
      This new local version handles both PBS and slurm.
      cam-fv scripts will use it instead of any system default version.
    
    mv_to_campaign.csh
    > It's still not entirely clear to me the minimum requirements for using globus.
    > A specific library version must be passed to ncar_pylib on compute nodes.
      On login nodes that is not needed.
    > Extended globus endpoint lifetime to 30 days.
    
    compress.csh
    > Made the action (gzip or gunzip) an argument instead of hard coded.
      Required changes to assimilate.csh and repack_st_archive.csh.
    > Generalized to work under PBS (mpiexec_mpt) and slurm (mpirun)
    
    repack_st_archive.csh
    > Extensive upgrades and rewriting.
    > It should only be run on casper, to have submit globus commands from the compute nodes.
    > Listed numbers of tasks needed for various subsets of do_{data_sets}.
    > Added section to archive {lnd,atm,ice,rof}/hist.
    > Improved instructions.
    > More setup error checks.
    > Implemented a cmds_template, since the same archiving commands are used
      in several places.
    > Adapted to ncrcat's current bugs and fixed my mistaken use of -A.
    > Changed variable name mpt_status to mpi_status to handle PBS and slurm.
    > Focused the script on archiving a chosen year and month,
      instead of assuming that all the files in archive are the right dates.
    > Moved some removals of files and directories into the new purge.csh script,
      which has to exist anyway to clean up after the asynchronous globus commands
      have finished.
    > Adapted to save_rest_freq being either a number or a day of the week.
    > Refined the cmd_file commands to handle more error conditions more effectively.
    > Fixed args to mv_to_campaign.csh, which were putting files in the wrong directories.
    > Commented out the running of obs_diag and matlab scirpts,
      since the plan is for this first repack_st_archive.csh to be
      a less comprehensive, easier+safer to implement script (snort)
      than the one I hope to use in the future.
      But it still repackages and archives the obs_space files.
    > Replaced echos of calls to mv_to_campaign.csh (for later use)
      with actual calls (from casper's batch nodes).
    > Added a section to archive the da.log files. (Other component's logs could be added).
    
    purge.csh
    > A script to remove files that are no longer needed after repack_st_archive.csh
      and globus have finished archiving.
    
    DART_config.template
    > Added archiving scripts to the list to be copied to $CASEROOT.
    
    assimilate.csh.template
    > Fixed test of numerical save_rest_freq to find all instead of just the first.
    > Improved handling of h0 and rh[0-9] files, prompted by history output from CLM.
    > Less frequent ls of h0 files, to prevent poor performance when the directory
      has thousands of files.
    > Commented out the run_shadow section for the same reason.
    > Removed the compression of obs_seq files because they are not huge+numerous
      and need to be processed at the end of each month.  Then they can be compressed
      by repack_st_archive.csh.

    repack_st_arch.csh
    > Added sections to repack and archive obs space and DART state space output.
    > Some file types are archived as time series, others as ensembles.
    > Added case name to job output file.
    > Added PBS options that are useful for development; running just single task sections
      or small ensembles.  These may be removed later to declutter.
    > Gather stages to process from input.nml.
    > Added nuance to the check of the tar error files in the restart section;
      don't die if the error is about log files, as opposed to inflation restarts.
    > The calls to globus via mv_to_campaign.csh are not active yet.
      The script prints the command for manual execution.
    > There's code to generate the obs space diagnostics using diags_batch.csh,
      and matlab, but the original intent was to generate those
      before running this script, then package the results in here.
      Doing it all in one script is planned for the future, and this piece
      would be part of it.
    > The new sections have been tested in pieces, fixing things along the way.
      They need comprehensive tests on clean directories from Reanalysis months.
    > Some additional cmdfile code might be added to accelerate these sections.
    > None of this has been reviewed.
    
    mv_to_campaign.csh
    > Fix the LABEL, which cannot have any '.' in it,
      which were sneaking in via the $CASE variable.
      More bomb-proofing might be needed here.
    
    diags_batch.csh
    > Kluge fix to allow user to run on cheyenne or casper.
      It needs to find obs_diag in a cam-fv/work directory
      corresponding to the computer.  This could be set automatically.
    
    obs_to_two_experiments.csh
    > Added warning that obs_common_subset is not guaranteed to work
      if the cases were run with different obs_seq files.
    
    assimilate.csh.template
    > Added .e to the stages' file name patterns which will (optionally) be removed
      during the run.

    setup_advanced_Rean_2017
       Changed DART root to 'reanalysis' 'from rma_recam'.
       Updated the restart set save frequency (see assimilate.csh.template notes)
    setup_hybrid
       Made the DART_config file executable, so that it can be run manually
       instead of within the setup scripts.
    assimilate.csh.template
     > Implement a more flexible way to specify how frequently to archive restarts;
       every_Nth_day (from the beginning of each month) or

     > Removed 'dart' from the compression.csh call,
       since I'll need to process them at the end of each month
       and the uncompressed binary versions don't take up much space.
    DART_config.template
       Fixed extra '-' in front of $VERBOSE argument.

    obs_to_two_experiments.csh
       A script to automate the processing of obs_seq_final files
       into pictures of differences of RMSE and abs(bias) between 2 cases,
       The pictures are generated by two_experiments_overview_Breck16.m
       (pre 2019-5-1) or two_experiments_overview_Breck16.m (post 2019-5-1).
     > It uses obs_seq_tool_series.csh to make the obs_seq_final files
       consistent enough for obs_common_subset to ingest them.
       The resulting obs_seq sets are fed to diags_batch.csh
       to generate obs_diag_output.nc files.
       Finally, those are fed to two_experiments_overview to generate
       the desired comparisons.
     > This has been tested, but not reviewed.
       It should get more error checking, and probably be made more flexible
       and able to start the process mid-stream, after unexpected failures.
    obs_seq_tool_series.csh
       A script to modify a series of obs_seq_final files to be consistent
       with another series, using obs_sequence_tool.
       Called by obs_to_two_experiments.csh or run as an independent interactive job.
       Tested, but not reviewed.
    diags_batch.csh
       A script to run obs_diag to generate obs_diag_output.nc files
       from a series of obs_seq_final files.
       It has baggage left over from its source version,
       which was designed to be submitted as an independent batch job.
       Tested, but not reviewed.  It may want a new name.

commit e8ba4ea1c8109d604c12a5c91780a617c2eeb9a3
Author: Kevin Raeder <raeder@ucar.edu>
Date:   Sat Apr 27 18:59:42 2019 +0000

    A script to repackage CAM6+DART output into forms that are
    useful and efficient for storage and future use.
    2 sections have been developed and work in the testing context:
    "forcing" files in the form of coupler history files,
    and restart data sets, including inflation.
    
    The restart section will call mv_to_campaign.csh,
    which submits a request to globus to transfer files,
    but that has not been tested in this version.
    Instead it writes out the mv_to_campaign.csh command
    that would/could be used.
    
    This script should be run as a batch job,
    since it uses the cmdfile mechanism.
    If it calls mv_to_campaign.csh, it must be run on casper,
    since the cheyenne compute nodes do not have access to globus.
    
    2 more sections will be added; obs space diagnostics
    (obs_diag and matlab scripts must be run first),
    and DART diagnostic files (esp/hist/..., atm/hist/$inst.e.$stages).
    
    It has not been reviewed.

    Added slurm directives.
    Moved execution of the creation of obs.list to the output_dir section,
    so that the file names will be created in the right form.
    Set date span of the plotting to be 00Z of the final day.
    Added path name of $DART/diagnostics/matlab to the script.m which is created.
    Added comment about starting Matlab with access to the NetCDF interface.
    Added diagnostic output.
    Fixed typos and minor errors.
    
    It runs as an independent batch job under slurm on casper
    and creates the desired pictures of the contents of obs_diag_output.nc.
    The output has not been carefully evaluated yet.
    The script has not been reviewed.

    This is a draft of a script to run obs_diag and matlab (noninteractively)
    as either a batch job or called from a near future, repackaging script
    for the Reanalysis (CAM6 forcing) output.
    It operates within the user's $archive/esp/hist directory.
    It harvests a list of obs_types from
       input.nml:{assimilate,evaluate}_these_obs_types
    and generates a matlab script to process them.
    Parts have been tested offline, but it has not been tested on a
    series of obs_seq.final files.

    the grand reintegration of the recam branch.  changes include:
    
    - The CAM Finite Volume (cam-fv)  model_mod.f90 has undergone substantial
      refactoring to improve simplicity and remove code for unsupported CAM variants
      while also supporting WACCM and WACCM-X
    
    - cam-fv setup and scripting support added for CESM 2_1, including advanced
      archiving and compression
    
    - COSMIC_ELECTRON_DENSITY has been moved from obs_def_gps_mod.f90 to
      obs_def_upper_atm_mod.f90, which has new quantities for
      ION_O_MIXING_RATIO and ATOMIC_H_MIXING_RATIO
    
    - Namelist option to select whether or not to compute posterior estimates of
      observations
    
    - added a DART QC of 8 for failed vertical conversions
    
    - obs_converters/gps/convert_cosmic_ionosphere.f90 has a test dataset
    
    - support for NAG compiler
    
    - closest_member_tool should be compiled with other MPI targets
    
    - fixed Intel compiler bug in lorenz_96 comparing long integers to integer loop indices
    
    - sampling error correction table now has all ensemble sizes between 3 and 200
    
    - get_maxdist() now a required routine all location modules
    
    - dart_time_io_mod: read_model_time, write_model_time  more stable behavior
    
    - obs_impact_tool handles a continuum of values, not just discrete 0 or 1.
    
    - fill_inflation_restart now produces files with names consistent with filter defaults.
    
    - expanded functionality in xyz_location_mod.f90
    
    - Removed 'slow' sorting routines from sort_mod.f90
    
    - replacing some repeated native netCDF library calls with routines from
      the netcdf_utilities_mod.f90

    for the CHANGELOG file in the top level directory.
    this should enable the gendocs program to run in

    commit to the rma_trunk the changes in filter:
    
    1. allow filter to skip the posterior forward operators
    and not write them to the output obs_seq.final
    
    2. only allocate space for additional copies in the
    obs_seq.final on task 0.  was previously allocating space
    on all tasks which was never used.
    
    3. keep doppler fold version of filter in sync.
    
    4. add a test in the inflation module to not allow
    skipping the posterior forward operators and enabling
    posterior inflation.
    
    5. update the namelist and html files to match

    The SST converters from Romain Escudier from while he was at Rutgers.
    He has a private GIT repo https://github.com/romain-escudier/Porthobs
    that I have forked as     https://github.com/timhoar/Porthobs
    
    Updated the observations.html page as it did not have a lot of the converters.
    There are still some undocumented converters ... I put placeholders in the
    Programs section. Many converters/directories are only documented with a README ...

    get rid of compile errors.  this is an alternative
    version of the prepbufr converter that is not finished
    but is intended to work for prepbufr files which were
    converted (by dss) to netcdf format instead of bufr.
    
    we stopped working on it when we found out that the
    netcdf version didn't have all the info we needed
    to create dart obs_seq files - but dss said they
    will add the fields we need so this may be a good
    converter to use someday.
    
    in the meantime make sure the repo version can at
    least build without error.

    make the default netcdf write time routine declare the

    this allows multiple files to be "stacked" along
    the time dimension to create a series.  the previous

    Reintegrating yz-cice branch. This codifies Yongfei's latest efforts.
    
    Using new /glade filesystem layout. Many of the observation converters
    that end in _to_obs_netcdf.f90 may be able to be consolidated and replaced by
    a perfect_model_obs run.

    for polar stereographic projections 'cone' is used
    and must be set to 1.0 instead of using what looks
    like a missing value of -999.  without setting this
    to 1.0 the code was incorrectly rotating the wind

    additional code changes beyond the immediate performance fix.

    the code and have the logic in subroutines; moving large
    amounts of space off the stack and into allocatable storage;
    removing some unused variables.

    serious performance fix - does not change the answer
    but was passing the original observation into get_close()
    routines instead of the already-converted vertical version
    of the obs.  this made running with a distribute_mean
    time-prohibitive.  this version fixes that and makes
    the performance acceptable again.

    start of a converter for NCEP obs distributed
    in NetCDF format instead of prepbufr format.
    this converter isn't finished because we discovered
    the files were missing some of the data we needed
    to determine exactly which obs types were there.
    also the expected errors were missing.  these were
    going to be added to the output files by the people
    writing the converters, so this program may be the
    way forward instead of continuing to try to parse
    prepbufr format.  see info on the NCAR RDA for
    dataste 337.0 - look for info on the subsetting
    option and asking for netcdf output instead of bufr.

    merging kevin's updates to the shell scripts directory
    to support the release of CESM 2.0.  the full update info:
    
    
    Based on the code reviews of setup_hybrid, setup_advanced,
    DART_config.template (new name), and [no_]assimilate.csh.template
    (new names), this commitment encodes clarification of the roles
    and use of setup_hybrid and setup_advanced.  It also includes
    many small improvements and simplifications.
    
    Setup_hybrid is now a purely CAM oriented script.
    DART_config must be run separately, in the $CASEROOT,
    to enable assimilation.  DART_config is no longer created
    by setup_hybrid, since DART_config gets all of its input
    from the user and from the copy of setup_hybrid in $CASEROOT.
    
    Setup_advanced is designed to be used when the user is
    confident in the ability to define and build an assimilation
    without intermediate checking and testing.  It runs DART_config
    by default, which turns on the assimilation in CESM.
    It still provides access to specialized capabilities,
    such as high resolution sea surface temperatures and WACCM(-X).
    
    The notable changes to the scripts include the following.
    
    All
    + Instructions and internal documentation have been updated.
    + Defining standard system commands (rm, cp, ...) has been made
      simpler, but less automatic.
    + New variables have been introduced to deal with some *nix
      systems not supporting the -v option to some variables.
      These variables are used to control echoing of commands.
    + Removed code that dealt with CISM, glacier, and land ice,
      since that component cannot work with DART due to a calendar
      conflict.  The exception is code that sets CISM_RESTART to FALSE,
      which was (is?) necessary even when the stub version is used.
    + Adopted the strategy of keeping
      DART_config.template in shell_scripts/cesm2_0, instead of
      DART_config          in shell_scripts.
      Then sed (or cp + editing) converts it into a usable DART_config
      in $CASEROOT.
    + Similarly for [no_]assimilate.csh; add .template to names and put in cesm2_0.
    
    setup_hybrid
    + Running it on 2 tasks speeds up the build by ~30%.
    + Environment variables have been removed,
      since setup_hybrid no longer calls DART_config.
      - dartroot
      - baseobsdir
      - save_every_Mth_restart_set
      - CAM_DYCORE
      - CLM_CONFIG_OPTS
      - ptile replaced by use_tasks_per_node
    + DART_config and `xmlchange DATA_ASSIMILATION_*` are no longer called.
    + Removed code which assisted with setting up WACCM.
      That code is still in setup_advanced.
    + Removed duplicated modification of case.st_archive header.
    + The CAM forecast job QUEUE and WALLCLOCK_TIME are now set
      by arguments to create_newcase, instead of xmlchange commands.
    + Simplify the flag to turn on CLM's interpolation of initial restart files.
      Default is now 'true'.
    + Removed vestiges of using non-default forcing files (GHG, aerosols, ...)
      until we figure out suitable options.
    
    stage_cesm_files
    + Replaced outdated cpl.r references with drv_####.r,
      since the multi-driver mode is the default for CAM+DART.
    + Use num_drivers to control the CESM file name formats used
      to fill rpointer files.
    
    setup_advanced
    + Most changes to setup_hybrid also appear in setup_advanced.
    
    DART_config.template
    + Added a section of environment variables, which will be filled by
      the user after running setup_hybrid (and checking the CAM forecasts),
      or be filled by setup_advanced.
    + Imported the xmlchange DATA_ASSIMILATION* commands from setup_*.
    + Num_instances is harvested from the setup script, since it cannot come
      from CESM when the multi-driver mode is used; each driver has 1 instance,
      and the total instances is not in the xml files.
    + Updated location of sampling error correction file.
    
    assimilate.csh.template
    + Making $archive/esp/hist is now done by DART_config.
    + Moved sampling error correction file acquisition to DART_config.
    + Removed the inflation cookie mechanism in favor of using fill_inflation_restart.
    + Require that output_file_list = input_file_list.
    
    no_assimilate.csh.template
    + Removed variables that are unneeded because of how no_assimilate.csh
      is created by DART_config.
    + Removed unnecessary purging of unneeded restart sets.
      No_assimilation runs will either have large ensemble restart sets and be short,
      or small sets and may be long.

    add some routines needed to create wrf diagnostic files, including
    4d arrays and being able to create r4 vs r8 attributes and variables
    (since wrf users sometimes build dart with r8=r4).
    
    also relax the requirement in the routine that returns a variable's
    dimension sizes that the size of the output array matches exactly
    the dimension of the variable.  now as long as it's large enough
    we don't complain.  set unused entries to -1 just in case the
    calling code references them accidently.

    more changes to be pushed to the Manhattan release.
    the changes in this particular commit include:
    (other changes have been committed earlier and are
    summarized in the CHANGELOG).
    
    - Enhanced inflation algorithm added.  See the filter_mod.html for new
    documentation on this option.
    
    - New parallel conversion scripts for GPS Radio Occultation observations and
      NCEP prepbufr conversions.
    
    - Further updates to documentation files to change KIND to QTY or Quantity.
    
    - Documented required changes when moving from the Lanai/Classic release to
    Manhattan in documentation/html/Manhattan_diffs_from_Lanai.html
    
    - Expanded the routines in the netcdf_utilities_mod.f90
    
    - Add an ensemble handle parameter to the 6 ensemble manager routines
    where it was missing.
    
    - The advance_time program can read/generate CESM format time strings
    (YYYY-MM-DD-SSSSS).
    
    - Fixed a bug in the netcdf read routines that under certain circumstances
    could report an array was using the unlimited dimension incorrectly.
    
    - Keep filter_mod.dopplerfold.f90 in sync with filter_mod.f90,
    and assim_tools_mod.pf.f90 in sync with assim_tools_mod.f90.
    
    - Removed makefiles for the obsolete trans_time program.

    clean up the conversion script a bit; use a better

    just the time string, which is used for other things.
    
    commit a script that runs from the command line or

    updates to the scripts used to convert gps radio occultation
    and gps ionospheric observations to dart obs_seq format.
    
    renamed some existing scripts to be more clear about
    what they do, and added some examples of how to run
    long series of conversion days.  also added the scripts
    i used to convert ionospheric obs (ionPrf data) to
    obs_seq format.  these are also committed to the
    openggcm branch so if/when we merge, this will already
    exist on the rma_trunk.
    
    the batch functions run on cheyenne and have
    sections for PBS and LSF.

    add comments to the gps forward operator and converter files
    to remind us that the local gps forward operator doesn't need the
    6 items of metadata that the non-local one does.  we could save
    memory and file space if we redefined the local and nonlocal gps obs
    to be different types.  (comments only, no code changes).
    
    minor non-results-changing update to text_to_obs.f90 converter:
    one of the compilers whines about a line that includes: a = b * -1
    because there's something unnatural about a star and a minus next to
    each other.  changed to:  a = b * (-1) and the minus sign is now
    safely quarantined in parens.
    
    i also had an example input text file with a few more lines
    so i updated that as well.

    update the makefile, add ftest_sendrecv.f90
    which i had sitting in another branch.
    
    this standalone makefile does include the mkmf.template
    but it doesn't currently run fixsystem automatically,
    so comment out the mpi system sections so these work
    with gfortran.

    and a section on the renaming of all the types/kind routines to the obs types
    and quantity version.  this info has never been anywhere in the release before.
    it certainly belongs a more places, but at least it's here now.

    expanded the netcdf cover routines in netcdf_utilities_mod.f90.
    will track mapping between ncid and original filename and include
    filename in output error messages now.  does more checks on number
    of dims when getting variable sizes.  will check for the scale and
    offset attributes when getting and setting variable values and
    fail if they are present.  if you run into this please save me
    a copy of the file for an example??
    
    removed the 'lanai_bitwise' option from assim_tools because
    we are confident in the manhattan version and it's getting almost
    impossible to reproduce the order of operations now between lanai
    and manhattan.  also removed the lanai perturb routines from several
    of the model_mods - it did the perturbation in the same order as
    lanai (which called perturb on an ensemble-by-ensemble basis and
    not as manhattan does with partial bits of the state for all ensemble
    members).  since we are ignoring lanai bitwise it simplifies the
    model_mod code to remove those uncalled routines.
    
    made sure the assim_tools_mod.pf.f90 and the filter_mod.dopplerfold.f90
    are in sync with the originals.
    
    removed the model-specific model_mod_check.f90 source files for all
    models except clm.  they were not being included by the path_names
    files anymore but still existed in the models directory.  clm stays
    but was cut down to just the routines which are unique to it.
    
    fixed the perturb routines in wrf and mpas_atm.  they are hardly
    ever used (a reasonable starting ensemble needs and some reasonable
    internal consistency) but i use them sometimes just for testing.
    the code wasn't handling multiple domains and the overall variable
    mins/maxes correctly.
    
    the rest of the model_mod changes were just to rename nc_redef to
    nc_begin_define_mode, nc_enddef to nc_end_define_mode, and nc_sync
    to nc_synchronize_file to be less inscrutable about what they were.

    there is a section of code that tries to write an english
    message to the log file to describe what characteristics
    of inflation the user has selected with all their choices.
    
    in constructing the log msg the test to see if the standard
    deviation was going to be allowed to adapt was just wrong,
    completely wrong.  note this had no effect on the running
    code or results, just on what was printed out into the dart log.
    
    it's less wrong now.

    Reintegrating branches/mmc
    
    Several model_mod_check programs were combined into a single
    assimilation_code/programs/model_mod_check/model_mod_check.f90
    that allows for selection of individual tests.
    
    The path_names and mkmf files have been updated. The namelists have
    been updated - and some models have had the model_mod_check_nml namelist
    removed because they did not build model_mod_check.
    
    Removed the lorenz_96 filter_ics.nnnn.nc because we don't support that usage pattern.
    
    several small-scale bugfixes and cleanup - listed here:
    
    assimilation_code/location/threed_sphere/location_mod.f90
            print format wider for fractional levels
    
    assimilation_code/modules/assimilation/assim_model_mod.html
            removed two routines, fixed documentation for
            get_closest_state_time_to
            get_initial_condition
    
    assimilation_code/modules/io/dart_time_io_mod.f90
            fixed variable type for 'time' variables we create.
    
    assimilation_code/modules/io/direct_netcdf_mod.f90
            only task 0 deallocates the arrays that task 0 allocates
    
    assimilation_code/modules/io/state_structure_mod.f90
            adding derived type component that allows reporting
            original file dimension IDs and lengths for the file.
    
    assimilation_code/modules/observations/DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90
            clearer reporting of observations assimilated/evaluated/precomputed
    
    assimilation_code/modules/utilities/cray_win_mod.f90
    assimilation_code/modules/utilities/no_cray_win_mod.f90
    assimilation_code/modules/utilities/null_win_mod.f90
            make observation ensemble handles optional in free_state_window()
            so windows can be used when there is only an ensemble of states
    assimilation_code/programs/perfect_model_obs/perfect_model_obs.f90
    
    models/cam-fv/model_mod.f90
            bug fix for calculating the U_WIND observations on height.
            U_WIND observations usually use pressure for the vertical.
    
    models/cam-fv/work/input.nml
            providing a default highest_obs_pressure_Pa that works with default
            cam model_version
    
    models/model_mod_tools/test_interpolate_threed_cartesian.f90
            fixed grid creation in test_interpolate_range(). Now uses
            correct spacing for grids in the x,y coordinates.
    models/model_mod_tools/test_interpolate*90
            allocate and initialize the array of error codes
    
    
    Removed model_mod_check namelist blocks from input.nml files that
            did not build model_mod_check.
    
    Added a new model_check_utilities_mod.f90 to all path_names_model_mod_check that
    contains routines common to all versions of model_mod_check.
    Updated all input.nml:model_mod_check_nml namelists to be consistent with
    the applicable model_mod_check program.
    
    
    models/clm/model_mod.f90
            the DART QTYs are now available via the state structure.
    
    models/wrf/model_mod.f90
            the DART QTYs are now available via the state structure.

    print only the first error code if debugging > 11.
    the code as committed was printing the error return for
    all ensemble members - which worked for small ensemble
    sizes but caused an error by overrunning the string length
    for large ensemble sizes.  soyoung is going to take a pass
    at removing some of the very low level print statements
    and consolidating others, to make the debugs more useful
    so i'm not going to do more than this quick fix right now.

    calls init, which calls register_module recursively.

    These scripts have support for slurm, pbs, and lsf.
    They are simpler and cleaner than previous versions.
    batch_job_resource_explanation.txt  is intended to provide
    a quick-start description for each queueing system.
    
    The get_ocean_time.csh script extracts the 'ocean_time'
    value from a ROMS netCDF file and puts it in a DSTART format
    that can be used to rename files, modify namelists etc.
    
    stage_experiment.csh is REQUIRED to be run initially.
    It copies the template files into place and replaces
    some strings with user supplied values and then makes
    the resulting scripts executable.

    These scripts demonstrate slurm, PBS, and LSF - all in the same script.
    That way we won't be stepping on each others setup when committing and
    it will simplify testing.
    
    The changes to model_mod.f90 reflect modifications needed to support
    the WC12 case - namely the calendar in use is (for some reason)
    'gregorian_proleptic' instead of just 'gregorian'.
    Since we are only running after 1601-01-01 ... there is no
    difference between the two.

    Changed comments about how the io buffer is being used. Previous
    comments were not clear that it was the buffer
    that was being filled all at once or in pieces.
    
    If all the variables can fit (one-by-one) in the buffer, there is no need to
    chunk the variable into pieces before distributing.

    The web page is now relevant for ROMS.
    The scripts need to be vetted for LSF.
    Since PBS and SLURM are so similar, it is not clear if both
    systems need to be supported. On at least one architecture,
    the SLURM block was ignored because it came after the PBS block
    and SLURM actually USED the PBS directives (before it found the
    SLURM directives). More testing is necessary.

    add RAW_STATE_VARIABLE to the simple advection defined observation
    types since it doesn't use the standard obs_def_1d_mod.f90 file.
    
    minor fixes in the obs_utilities to handle the cases where the
    caller asks for the fill value and none exists for that variable.
    it should return MISSING_R8 in that case but in some cases it
    returned unset and in others it was a fatal error.
    
    update the change log for last few changes.

Author: Tim Hoar <thoar@ucar.edu>
Date:   Wed Oct 25 16:54:58 2017 +0000

    Using the hgtransform method to plot the flat earth representation under scatterplots for georeferencing.
    Renaming the helper function 'myworldmap' -> 'FlatEarth' and putting it in the private directory.
    The add_gray_color() function adds a light gray color as the lowest entry in the colormap and changes
    the clim to preserve the original data limits.

    in the dart_obs_seq_mod, added a width to a write format
    spec because gfortran forces 'i' formats to have a width.
    
    added the -D_REAL8_ cpp flag in the mkmf_gsi_to_dart
    makefile.  this now successfully compiles on cheyenne
    with both intel and gfortran.  i left comments about
    the older way of building this executable in which
    it used cpp to preprocess the file.  on cheyenne with
    gfortran this didn't work because c-style comments
    were inserted at the top of the file which caused the
    fortran compile to fail.

    Fixed indexing of model_h in definition of highest_obs_height_m,

    Added check of whether highest_obs_pressure_Pa is set uselessly high,
    which causes problems for setting highest_obs_height_m.
    
    Changed KINDs to QTYs.

    replace the fortran intrinsic dble() with either _r8
    (for constants), with real(x,r8) (for variables which
    aren't declared as r8), or just remove it for vars
    which are already declared as r8.  then this code
    compiles correctly when r8 is defined as single precision.

    change the handling for surface obs - interpolate from
    the z face array, not the z center array, which changes
    depending on the height of level 2.   also define surface
    obs as having a scale height of -log(1) instead of computing
    two values which may be almost but not quite exactly 1.
    
    if the vertical location of an obs is at level 1, return
    a vertical location of lower=1, upper=1 and fraction = 0.
    this will work correctly with both 2d and 3d fields and
    will not generate an out-of-bounds array access for 2d
    fields (which have no level 2).
    
    support putting surface variables into the state vector
    to compute forward operators for temperature, winds,
    and specific humidity.

    Added documentation for the observation error variance specification choices.

    Adding the option to use the newer error functions (circa trunk:r9958 2016-03-11)
    and infrastructure for supporting bending angle.
    
    The NCEP/prep_bufr/install.sh script had an option to die on unset variables
    that was not needed - and caused a fatal error on OSX (if someone does not
    have a 'CC' environment variable set - like me).

    in the past we've committed the gfortran version of
    these files.  we often use intel these days but for
    now i'm going to revert this back to the gfortran version.
    (shouldn't really matter since mkmf calls fixsystem for
    us now; it just shows up as a different from the repository
    if you do an svn diff and you're using intel.)

Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Thu Sep 21 22:59:34 2017 +0000

    add a namelist option to make a copy of the buffer before
    a broadcast (was already an option to do this for send/recv).
    this is expected to be needed only for mpi implementations
    which can't deal with array sections properly.
    
    rearrange the code in send, recv, and broadcast to combine
    sections in a more sane way depending on whether you are
    making a copy or not.  support the copy option even if
    you have to break large transfers up into multiple operations.
    
    you should *not* need to make these copies; they cost time
    and space.  however when trying to debug strange mpi problems
    trying them out is a good initial test.
    
    there is still an issue on what the max buffer limit should
    be for a single operation; we currently use 2,000,000,000
    (not 2 * 1024^3) for both send, recv, and broadcast.
    johnny says it might be necessary to drop this slighly for
    broadcast with some of the mpi implementations on cheyenne.

    bug fix:
    
    don't call convert_vertical_obs() on tasks which don't have obs.
    model_mod code might not be expecting a size of 0 (and better not
    to assume it would.)  do the same with state even though currently
    we don't allow #tasks to be larger than the state vector size.
    
    fixes for other things:
    
    - increase integer format width in count_close messages
    - add timer around count_close() based on brian's comment that
       the all_reduce is slow on large task counts
    - combine 2 missing_in_state vars into one
    - add comment in spread_restoration about the fix craig proposed
       for the case of 0 spread in the obs prior variance.  not part
       of the code yet because it might not be sufficient
    - remove old debug section in code that "can't happen" to avoid
       confusion

    fix a serious error (that i created) when pre-converting the vertical
    coordinates for either obs or state vector items.  the 'count' in the
    call from assim_tools() is the number of separate items.  it was being
    passed directly to an existing convert_vert() routine that expected to
    convert an ensemble of locations where all had the same lon/lat and might
    only differ in the vertical.  i believe it would hammer numbers 2-N with
    the lon/lat from item 1.
    
    only print debug messages which have global information
    (grid sizes, variables in the state vector, etc) on a single
    task instead of all tasks.

    The converter reads the lookup table from I-Te, and we removed the
    scaled height method of determining the observation error variances as per
    email with I-Te.  There is a problem using the lookup table - turn on
    array bounds checking and things get references outside array bounds.
    Changed the ionprf_obserr_percent() routine to use the native height
    units of km, consistent with the heights in the cosmic data files.
    Unrelated to the array bounds problem.

    This data file was created by I-Te Lee:
    "First of all, the original idea  error of ionospheric observation is 1%. Thus, I put
    the code as "oerr = 0.01_r8 * obsval". Liu et. al and Yue et al investigated the Abel
    inversion error of COSMIC ionosphere profile, both of them figure out the large error
    would appear at the lower altitude and push model toward wrong direction at the lower
    ionosphere while assimilating these profiles.
    
    On the other hand, the Abel inversion error is depended on the ionospheric electron
    density structure, which function of local time, altitude and geomagnetic latitude.
    Therefore, to simplify the procedure to define observation error of profiles,
    Xinan Yue help me to estimated a error matrix and saved in the file which named 'f3coerr.dat'.
    
    The file included a 15 by 37 by 25 (altitude - latitude - local time) matrix,
    ranging from 100-800 km within 50 km interval, -90 to 90 degree in geomagnetic
    latitude within 5 degree interval, and 0 to 24 local hr with 1 hr interval.
    
    The number in the matrix is error percentage (%), which calculated by OSSE.
    Please check the attached files for that two reference papers .
    
    In the end, the observation error is summed up of instrumentation error (10%) and Abel error."
    
    I converted the file to netCDF, the references are included as global metadata.

    Implement support for identity observations in the oned version of obs_diag.
    Simply use the QTY_STATE_VARIABLE and go through the same logic as any other.
    Could extend this to use the get_state_meta_data() routine to return
    the exact QTY in all the obs_diag programs for 'perfect' behavior.
    
    The documentation for the threed_sphere/obs_diag has a better explanation of
    what happens when there are no observations in what looks to be perfectly
    good levels ... specified with the wrong units or are totally out-of-range.

    clm_restart files are now bitwise with the trunk, with
    the exception of H2OSNO, which has some slight
    differences which has to do with the order which
    clamping is applied.
    
    adding clm_to_dart and dart_to_clm, which marks missing_r8
    values to the state.  There is one additional namelist for
    filter_nml 'allow_missing_clm' which is only to be used for
    CLM assimilation. this was previously in assim_tools_nml
    
    there is an additional module options_mod.f90 which gets and
    sets whether or not you can have missing values in your state
    vector.  this avoids circular dependencies and can be accessed
    directly by the model_mod.

    try to build the BUFR libs with the same compiler
    as we're building the rest of dart with.  it comes
    with its own install.sh script so the compiler choice
    was hardcoded inside it.  change the buildall script
    to set a couple env vars and then have the install script
    use them if set - so the gps bufr converter should now
    build ok with intel, gnu, or pgi.  i know we support
    more compilers but 99% of our testing is with intel
    and gfortran.  add more cases if this gets annoying for
    some other compiler.  otherwise update the install.sh
    script by hand before testing.

Author: Tim Hoar <thoar@ucar.edu>
Date:   Tue Aug 8 15:39:00 2017 +0000

    Updated graphics to be consistent with recent versions of Matlab and
    our functions. The default colorbars changes circa 2014b.
    Section 5 is Adaptive Inflation.  The original .pptx under git control is
    corrupt, and some of the figures have significant jitter - so at some point
    it needs to be fixed.

commit 8b8fbf1e4389699c557b02710ec8ac359c23104f
Author: Kevin Raeder <raeder@ucar.edu>
Date:   Fri Aug 4 17:36:18 2017 +0000

    The main changes are to mesh Manhattan's hard wired file names
    with CESM's file name convention.
    
    setup_hybrid and setup_advanced:
       Replaced user_nl_cam section with comments about updating to CESM2 forcing
          files and namelist mechanism for activating them.
       Removed modifications of case.lt_archive, since it appears to not be use in CESM2.
       Updated modification of env_archive.xml for 6 stages, no cpl.r, da.log changes.
       Added check_finidat_year_consistency = .false. to user_nl_clm_####.
       New WACCM env variable section, to pass to DART_config.
    assimilate.csh;
       Adapted it to handle all 6 stages of filter output.
       Write all data files to CESM naming convention:
          $CASE.$component.$type.[$string.]$date[$ending]
             type = e  (for compenent 'esp'), or i for initial file mean, sd.
             string = filter output filename = ${stage}{_inf}_{mean,sd,member_####,...},obs_seq.final.
          This is described more fully in JIRA ticket 361 and Google doc
             https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WpAA6vdNMikDd5qr7eBqZ2J8r1ug0zAvHJjDfjiz_i0/edit?ts=5797c671#
             Revision: ----------------------
       Moved the population of the Hide directory to the end of assimilate.csh to:
          prevent st_archive from archiving 2 restart sets at last job cycle,
          clean up the beginning of the script.
       Replaced complicated shell variable use with simple, clearer variables.
    
    DART_config
       New WACCM 'preferred DART namelist values' section
    Added SourceMods/src.drv/seq_io_mod.F90 to fix the NetCDF file size
       limit on the cpl.r file (Git issue #1705).

Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Thu Aug 3 21:13:36 2017 +0000

    make the column and channel versions compatible with the updated
    manhattan interfaces.  these hadn't worked before.  remove all the
    octree code from the channel version - it was never working and isn't
    needed in this type of location module.
    
    fix the routine name in 2 error messages in the threed_sphere
    version, and remove a reference to nc_check() which isn't used anymore.
    
    remove an unused integer from the threed_cartesian derived type
    and remove an unused subroutine from the code.

    the previous one was skipping the ones which weren't working
    so it wasn't much of a test.

    setup_advanced:
       Added check of the selected 1/4 degree, daily SST file.
          Does it have the "gregorian" calendar attribute?

Author: Johnny Hendricks <Johnny>
Date:   Thu Jul 20 23:07:59 2017 +0000

    Merging in the branch rma_array_nml.  Now you can specify
    your restart files as either a list of files, which is
    convinient for perfect_model_obs, model_mod_check and
    others that only need to read in one ensemble member, or
    you can give a file list text file that contains a list
    of the restart files you would like to read in.  This
    works for the 'single file io' case, multiple domains
    and either a combination of lists and array file
    specification.

    Adding better error messages for when the CopyMetaData or QCMetaData
    strings do not match what is in the file.
    Moved read_obs_netcdf.m out of the private directory because the
    web pages give an example on how to use it.

    updated for kinds -> quantities.   obs_sequence_mod
    still has documentation for get_expected_obs() which
    should be in the obs_def_mod docs - this is still TODO.

Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Mon Jul 17 19:49:52 2017 +0000

    fix an 'off by one' error in computing the specific obs types
    which correspond to a generic observation quantity, when building
    an obs impact table.
    
    fix some code that validates that there are enough members in
    a single-input file - error checking was too strict if starting
    from a single member and perturbing it.  also rearranged some
    code that was calling a validation routine once per loop instead
    of once up front (did not depend on anything inside the loop).

    forced_barot (which we cannot compile) was referencing an ancient

    commit it, and THEN merge it onto the manhattan branch.
    
    last time i updated it on the manhattan branch after
    i'd done the merge, and so those change notes were
    not in the rma_trunk CHANGELOG file for the next update.

    Committing contents of shell_scripts/cesm2_0_beta05
    for use by Bacmeister and by Barre'.  The tests for
    Bacmeister used gw_{drag,rdg}.F90 pulled from cam5_4_120
    (~cesm2_0_alpha06i).
    The main updates:
    > handle the output from the st_archive job better,
    > handle the DART's (intermediate) version of config_archive.xml more cleanly,
    > search for WACCM within the long compset name more robustly in the CESM2 environment.

Author: Johnny Hendricks <Johnny>
Date:   Thu Jun 22 22:22:13 2017 +0000

    Merging in the branch rma_mmc.  The code can now run with
    oned, twod, threed_cartesian, and threed_sphere location
    modules.
    
    There is additional code to run model_mod_check with
    the single_file option (all members in one file) in
    the namelist 'single_file'.
    
    restart_file_list has been renamed to input_state_files
    and similarly for output_state_files.
    
    Moved model_mod_check to the programs directory and updated
    the html and all model's path_names and nmls to be consistent
    with the location of model_mod_check.f90.

    These files reproduce what the CICE results Yongfei generated with
    with an earlier version of the rma_cice branch (which we pruned a while ago).
    The results were generated on yellowstone.
    Have yet to test Cheyenne.
    Only tested the 'simple squeeze' method in dart_to_cice.
    The test case is in /glade/p/image/DART_test_cases/cice

    Adding observation converter support for CICE.
    Most of these read a CICE restart file that has had noise added to it.
    That happens offline, and then those perturbed restart files are run
    through the different converters. Since the observations are
    from every gridpoint, Yongfei found it easier to do this than generating
    an obs_seq.in for each gridpoint.
    These converters were developed by Yonfei Zhang - University of Washington.

    allow -default as the mpi flag, which compiles
    models using the quickbuild default (instead of

    minimal changes to the wrf model_mod to fix problems
    with interpolating in fields with a vertical stagger
    (vertical velocity and geopotential height).  there

    restore a "working" input.nml.  the previous version was accidently
    overwritten by the workshop version and committed.
    
    NOTE that this one differs from what we distributed with Lanai,
    but it is simplified and gives a good assimilation result.
    it turns off inflation and turns off localization.  this is
    intentional.  the goal of the default input.nml is that if someone
    just runs filter, they should see a reasonable assimilation result
    and not write us for support.

Author: Johnny Hendricks <Johnny>

    adding variable attributes to single file diagnostic files.
    
    renaming variables and subroutines to be more intuitive and
    cleaning up some comments and removing unused variables.
    
    using inherit_units instead of has_units for variable argument.
    this is used mainly for setting the unitless attribute for
    inflation files.

    found a few more places where QTY_RAW_STATE_VARIABLE was still
    lurking.  this has changed to simply QTY_STATE_VARIABLE.
    most of the changes were either in documentation, in the
    model_mod_check namelist, or in comments in the code.

    add lorenz 96 2-scale model mod to the rma release.
    updated diagnostics to match.  added 2 new obs types
    and quantities for this model (large scale and small
    scale).  it was only working before because it was
    only assimilating identity obs.
    
    update the test routines to allow '-default' as a flag
    which says compile the models with or without mpi depending
    on what the default for that quickbuild is.
    
    add new routines to the netcdf utils to create more types of
    variables and attributes.  add more options to allow the
    location variable to have a name different than 'locations'.
    
    change failed vertical convert from QC 7 to QC 4 - after testing
    it should be changed to QC 8.

Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>

    jeff prefers to have all the ensemble members in the state diag files,
    and the entire ensemble of obs values in the obs_seq.final so change
    both counts in the namelist to 80 (which is the ensemble size for this
    model).  this differs from this namelist in the lanai release where
    num_output_state_members was 30 and num_output_obs_members was 20.

    The input.nml now has values from the Lanai release, specifically the
    num_output_* and perturbation_amplitude.
    
    The PlotTotalErr.m script had not been totally updated to reflect the
    changes for the native Matlab netCDF support.

    fix a serious bug in the fall velocity forward operator.
    if the fall speed field is not in the state the test
    for a bad istatus from the interpolate call was looking
    at the wrong variable and returning ok even if interpolate
    had set bad values.
    
    removed p_istatus and pass the real istatus array into
    the first call to interpolate().  if any succeed then
    return with istatus set correctly.  otherwise continue
    down to compute fall velocity in a different way.

    The main purpose of this commit is to add the unit conversion
    of chemical species for CAM-chem into the Manhattan release.
    The conversion is no longer done on the whole state vector
    before the assimilation.  It's done on the obs estimates.
    Additional of chemical species' QTYs were to added to
    DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90.
    
    Many comments were updated to reflect moving from
    Classic to Manhattan (RMA).  Not all of the clean-up is done.
    Removed code and comments related to CAM-SE, which will be in a
    separated model 'cam-se'.
    Removed vestiges of using 'stand alone' CAM.  This model_mod will
    only work within the CESM environment.
    Fixed a suboptimal exit from the loop searching for highest_obs_height_m.
    
    This compiles on Cheyenne, but has not been tested yet.
    Jerome Barre' will do that.

    Added cesm2_0_beta05 for development work.  Changes will eventually be folded into cesm2_0
    and this directory will be removed.
    
    Mainly added options in the setup scripts to handle cheyenne's PBS environment.
       Removed last of the BATCH_SYSTEM code, which is unneeded and doesn't work in CESM2_0_beta05.
    CESM's case.st_archive didn't work, which prompted changes to the archiving
    sections of the setup and DART_config scripts.
    > Moved modifications of case.{st,lt}_archive out of DART_config into setup_{hybrid,advanced}.
    > Moved all modifications of case.{st,lt}_archive to follow case.setup call
      (so that they exist when setup* modifies them).
    > Added changes to {st,lt}_archive to work better on cheyenne; use 1 processor in 'share'
      instead of 36 in 'regular'.
    Fixed special character escapes in inflation cookie section.
    
    CAM doesn't give the same answers on cheyenne, so the test cases CAM4_test2_hyb and
      CAM6_test2_adv don't give the same answers as *test1* from yellowstone.
    Removed spinup* and obs_seq_tool_series.csh because they aren't needed in this development dir.

    These functions use whatever filename is specified by 'diagn_file' as
    the default file name to use when prompting. Whatever you specify at
    the prompt is used, but does not affect the setting of 'diagn_file'.
    
    You can specify the true state via  the 'truth_file' variable,
    which has a default value of 'true_state.nc'.  This is not prompted for,
    by design.
    
    There was an error in CheckModelCompatibility in that the model name
    in each of the files came from the same file - so they always matched. Oops.

Author: Kevin Raeder <raeder@ucar.edu>
Date:   Sat May 13 15:14:15 2017 +0000

    This is for an intermediate CESM, before the (hopefully stable) release in June 2017.
    It was used for Bretherton's clouds experiment and for interfacing the developing
    Manhattan release and CESM2.
    It's based on the stages {in,out}put, {pre,post}assim, but no {forecast,analysis},
    and doesn't include Nancy's model_mod changes of ~2017-5-11,
    or changes for running on Cheyenne.  It is a step in that direction.
    
    There are many fixes to the st_archive tool, which hopefully will disappear
    from DART when CESM2 is released with a st_archive which handles DART output.
    Config_archive.xml is a replacement for the CESM version because the original
    uses the wrong file name form for creating rpointer files in archive/rest/$date.
    Case_st_archive.py is also a replacement due to many multi-instance errors
    in the original.
    There is also a section in setup* which modifies the env_archive.xml to handle
    the current stages of DART output.
    
    The disk space management by assimilate.csh during runs has become complicated
    with the stages in Manhattan.  I'm considering making it a separate script,
    called by assimilate.csh.
    
    Setup_* (test versions) and assimilate.csh were tested in cases
      setup_advanced: CAM6_test1_adv
      setup_hybrid  : CAM4_test1_hyb
    which are 3 member, single day assimilations.
    
    The 2 spinup_single* scripts should be condensed into 1.
    For the moment it's useful to leave them separate, since that's what
    was used for the development work of this CESM.

    we agreed that we would commit the default versions
    of the MPI-capable path_names files; so if quickbuild
    for this model defaulted to building with MPI, the MPI
    versions would be committed.  if it defaulted to building
    serial, the serial version would be committed.  these
    should match the quickbuild defaults.  hopefully this
    makes 'svn status' easier to understand because these
    files shouldn't be different as often anymore.

    massive update to the model_mod required interfaces, to the
    location_mod interfaces, added default model_mod interfaces,
    the start of netcdf utilities.  test this version carefully
    before we push it to the manhattan release.
    
    see the last section in the CHANGELOG file for the details
    of what has changed in the interfaces and namelists.

    Intended Usage:
    1) configure and run stage_experiment.csh
    2) cd to the experiment directory and confirm the setup is OK
    3) sbatch advance_ensemble.csh     (and take note of the jobID)
    4) sbatch --dependency=afterok:<jobID> run_filter.csh
    5) check that all is well, and execute 3 & 4 again

    the scripting is fundamentally in three pieces:
    1) stage_experiment.csh
    2) advance_ensemble.csh
    3) run_filter.csh
    ... and repeat 2,3 for as many cycles as desired.
    Communication of the new DSTART (when to start/stop) yet to be done.
    
    The PGI compiler is core dumping in filter --
    debug options not much help *sigh*.

Date:   Thu May 4 16:15:17 2017 +0000

    A big step towards using SLURM on eddy at UCSC.
    The intent is that 'stage_experiment.csh' will stage an experiment
    and modify and copy some template scripts into that directory.
    Then, advance_ensemble.csh is a job array that will advance all the members
    in separate jobs and run_filter.csh is a dependent job that will be
    configured to run when all the model advances have successfully completed.
    Some things not quite finished.

    commit the version of this code which uses the new
    netcdf sampling_error_correction table.  all the path_names
    files should have already included the needed modules
    but this version was never committed.  we still may need
    a way to point users to where to pick up the sampling
    error correction file.  right now it is in the
    assimilation_code/programs/gen_sampling_err_table directory
    which seems a bit tough to find.  the file itself is only
    160K - perhaps we should commit a version of it in the
    work directories of all the large models?  i'm open to
    ideas here.  symbolic links are a problem for subversion
    or i'd suggest those.

    rework the clamping code so it outputs only a single line
    per variable, and add (currently commented out) cases for
    when we need to clamp CLM variables which potentially could
    have missing values.  it's computationally expensive to
    do masked operations if they can't happen so we need access
    to the 'allow_missing_in_clm' in this module before we
    enable that code.

    update the gpsro_bufr defaults, add mkmf and path names files.
    add the converter that reads netcdf files for ionosphere obs.
    the gps forward operator module just defines an electron density
    type; no new code.   the gpsro_bufr build requires that you
    build the ncep bufr library first.  this should go in the
    .html file when we make one.

    make this not fail if there aren't any cdl files in this
    current directory.   foreach i ( *.bob ) fails if there are
    no files with the bob extension, but foreach i ( `ls *.bob` )
    just echoes 'ls: not found' and continues on.  i'd like to use
    the same build script for all directories (or as many as possible).
    
    this change allows this script to work for any directory that
    needs to build and run preprocess first, with or without cdl files.
    we'll need a second version that just finds and runs mkmf scripts
    for the 4 or 5 dirs which don't have preprocess as a prerequsite.

    removing month_lenghts and using the cf-convention of
    "none" for no_calandar in the low order models.  This
    fixed and error in ncview 2.1.7 which would not display
    variables with no calendar and units with
    days since xxxx-xx-xx xx:xx:xx.  Units for low order models
    are all now in days.
    
    nondimensional was also removed from the units as it was not
    complient with ncview.  nondimensional variables should be
    written without a units attribute.

    make the calendar type 'none' instead of 'no calendar'
    for models which don't have a seasonality or an actual
    calendar.  but the real key is to make the units be 'days'
    and NOT 'days since xxx' because that causes postprocessing
    tools to try to interpret the 'days since' attribute
    relative to a calendar. it fails in various ways on
    various versions of ncview/udunits2, including crashing.
    making the 'units' be simply 'days' makes the plots
    have a reasonable axis label.

    change the default of 'distribute_mean' in the &assim_tools_nml
    namelist.  since this item is new with the manhattan release,
    people with existing input.nmls may not have this item in their
    namelist and so the default value is even more important.  we chose
    to have it run faster - if the state vector is large the program
    will crash with an out-of-memory error and changing the value of
    this item may enable them to run.  the converse setting ran but
    could be very slow for some models.

Date:   Fri Mar 24 17:38:33 2017 +0000

    Adding the rough outline of the model_mod.html for the bgrid model.
    Removed the nuisance parameter 'output_state_vector' from the namelist,
    and removed the capability to blast out the state vector as a 1D array
    instead of parsing it back into variables. I'm pretty sure we could not
    read the 1D array back in, so ...

    Making changes to resolve some broken links and
    removed all the references to 'Website' vs. 'local' as a single relative link
    works in both circumstances.
    
    The 'wrf' links in the Supported Models section referenced the wrong model,
    as did a couple others.
    
    There is no cm1 model_mod.html, but we reference one.

    Update filter.nml to match the entries in assimilation_code/modules/assimilation/filter_mod.f90.
    The order is patterned after the order in lorenz_96, but has a few more variables,
    and a small amount of regrouping.  initial_time_{days,seconds} and perturbation*
    were moved to the input section.
    
    The same order is used in filter.html, both in the namelist reproduced there
    and in the table of namelist variable descriptions.
    All default values have been checked.

Author: Kevin Raeder <raeder@ucar.edu>

    Fixed (reduced) the vertical spacing in a table in
    models/CESM/doc/setup_guidelines.html
    which shows directory heirarchies and has spaces to denote subdirectories.
    The mechanism involves an adding a class to doc.css;
    
    .keepspace tr, .keepspace td { white-space: pre; }
    
    then using that class in the table in setup_guidelines.html;
    
    <div class="keepspace" >
    <table
    ...
    </table
    </div>
    
    This doesn't appear to interfere with other tables.

Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Wed Mar 15 16:47:52 2017 +0000

    ncview 2.1.7 crashes if the time variable has the calendar
    attribute of 'no_calendar' and has a 'units' of days since
    0000-01-01.  our solution for now is to remove the units
    for the no_calendar case (it remains for gregorian calendars).
    
    this behaves differently for different versions of ncview
    (or possibly different versions of udunits/udunits2) so be
    careful when testing.

commit a72d5d27b481c84d98927257bcf08535c0d31bd0
Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Tue Mar 14 22:21:51 2017 +0000

    for the io modules, set the calendar type back
    to 'no_calendar' instead of 'none'.  ncview complains
    about 'none' as the calendar type, even though it is
    documented on the CF conventions page and looks like
    the closest to what we need to use.
    
    put the obs_impact code into assim_tools_mod and
    add calls to the timing routines using the code in
    mpi_utilities instead of calling MPI_WTIME() directly.
    there is a null_mpi_utilities version which will use
    the system clock if not compiling with mpi.  the controls
    for the timing routines are local variables in the routine.
    
    call get_close_state_init() and get_close_state() from
    assim_tools.  there are bypass routines in assim_model
    so for today we don't have to put them into every model_mod.
    we need to sort out the model_mod interfaces asap so people
    don't have to convert their code more than once.
    
    but this compiles, and runs the 2 domain wrf test ok.

Author: Kevin Raeder <raeder@ucar.edu>
Date:   Tue Mar 14 21:37:49 2017 +0000

    Added shell_scripts/no_assimilate.csh, which is referenced by ./DART_config,
    Removed same from shell_scripts/cesm#_#.
    
    Modified setup scripts and DART_config to make a single version of DART_config
    work with the cesm1_5 and cesm2_0 setup scripts.  Moved DART_config out of
    the cesm#_# directories.  But the setup_scripts will still look in their own
    directory for DART_config, in case a specialized one has been put there.
    
    Added setup_advanced, which can set up more specialized CAM assimilations,
    including using the high resolution SSTICE data sets (AVHRR).
    
    Added cesm2_0/spinup_single* for setting up and running a single member CAM
    from Jan 1 to the desired ensemble spinup start date.
    
    Updated work/input.nml.

    move the default_model_mod to a new utilities directory.
    anything that's in the template directory should be suitable
    for a user porting a new model to copy to a new directory
    and start development.
    
    updated the L63 path_names files which included the
    default_model_mod.f90 to use the new location.

    First commit of doc/setup_guidelines.html, which is a broad stroke description
    of the procedure for setting up a CESM+DART  assimilation from scratch.
    It references other docs for more details.  It uses cam-fv as an example.
    It's all text for now.  Formatting would like some improvement.
    
    Also commit updated README with corrected terminology and a bit more information.

    delete files which are obsolete, like dart_to_model
    and model_to_dart.  rename 'full_model_mod' to
    'geo_model_mod'. it still has code to read/write
    binary state vectors so needs to be updated for RMA.

Author: Kevin Raeder <raeder@ucar.edu>
Date:   Fri Mar 10 23:44:08 2017 +0000

    This script creates a pseudo-ensemble from a single member
    set of CESM restart and initial files.  This is useful because
    a multi-instance CESM forecast needs to have an initial file set
    for each member, but we use a single member CESM to spin up from
    the default Jan 1 date to near the assimilation period.
    This is needed even if filter's
       perturb_from_single_instance = .true.
    which makes filter will read only the first file from input_state_file_list.
    
    At some point, this could/should be merged into 'stage_cesm_files',
    which is created and run by the set-up scripts.

    massive reorganization of the DART code to make
    it less intimidating for new users.
    
    the DART code is now arranged into seven directories
       * assimilation_code ( contains programs and modules )
       * build_templates ( renamed from mkmf )
       * diagnostics ( common matlab diagnostic code )
       * documentation
       * developer_tests
       * models ( unchanged )
       * observations ( contains obs converters and forward operators )

    This uses the additions for the POP2 namelists without breaking
    the earlier pop_in namelist support. Also supports along-track
    sea level anomaly observation assimilation.  The long-term mean
    dynamic topography file is read from the &model_nml:mdt_reference_file_name
    variable.  The size of the 'mdt' variable is compared to the expected
    size, the units are converted to SI upon read - as the observations
    are also SI, and the forward operator requires SI.
    
    The setup and assimilate scripts work with the new assumed filenames
    and support the netCDF-only logic.  The assimilate script allows
    DART to modify the restart files directly - no safety or backup files are created.
    If the assimilation corrupts the POP .r. file, you must revert to a previous
    restart set.
    
    The AVISO converter 'makedaily.sh' script is simpler and supports the
    addition of the WOD observations into the output observation sequence file.

    collected updates for many different reasons.  list of
    changes are:
    
    adaptive_inflate/adaptive_inflate_mod.f90:
       add rtps inflation
    common/types_mod.f90:
       add missing_i8
    filter/filter_mod.f90:
    filter/filter_mod.dopplerfold.f90:
       add rtps inflation
       re-enable check_file_info_variable_shape() for output file
       add back in perturb capability for single-file input
       bring dopplerfold in sync with plain version
    forward_operator/forward_operator_mod.f90:
       fix doxygen, no code changes
    io/dart_time_io_mod.f90:
       add support for different calendars to created single-file output
       files we create, add support for reading times with 'days since' or
       'seconds since' a base time in netcdf attrs.
    io/direct_netcdf_mod.f90:
       add code, currently disabled, which would update the time
       in an existing output file if it isn't the same as the model_time.
       not sure if this is a good idea - might need to be namelist
       selectable - but was needed for a ROMS run and don't want to
       lose the code.
    io/io_filenames_mod.f90:
       fix code using num_dims instead of the correct io_num_dims
       improve some error messages
    io/state_space_diag_mod.f90:
       add back in the capability for perturbing a single state
       fix the computation of variable shapes so we can re-enable
       check_file_info_variable_shape(), taking into account the
       possible 'time' and 'member' dimensions
       use the actual dims instead of assuming positions in the array
    io/state_structure_mod.f90:
       fix the code that computes variable sizes in the single file case
       (don't include the time or member dimensions)
       remove extra trim() intrinsics when comparing strings; you need
       it for prints or writes, but not for comparisons
       fix one call which needs to include the time and member
       dimensions which wasn't before
    io/state_vector_io_mod.f90:
       includes passing down the perturb flag to read_singlefile
    models/bgrid_solo/model_mod.f90:
       added an optional 'template_file' namelist item so we can
       get the sizes and shapes of the arrays from that file,
       instead of trying to construct the domain from scratch.
       if not starting from a restart file, leave template_file
       unset and the domain will be constructed as before.
    models/bgrid_solo/work/input.nml:
       add template_file to model_nml namelist
    models/wrf/distributed_phb_model_mod.f90:
       all_reduce_min_max renamed to broadcast_minmax
    mpi_utilities/mpi_utilities_mod.f90:
    mpi_utilities/null_mpi_utilities_mod.f90:
       remove obsolete comment block at top; add broadcast_flag
       and broadcast_minmax; deprecate all_reduce_min_max
       convert to doxygen comments and style guide
       add start_mpi_timer/read_mpi_timer to
       wrap mpi_wtime() - corresponding routines
       using the normal clock added to null mpi version
    obs_def/obs_def_gps_mod.f90:
    obs_def/obs_def_tpw_mod.f90:
    obs_def/obs_def_upper_atm_mod.f90:
    observations/ROMS/convert_roms_obs.f90:
       fix the format of the doxygen 'todo's so they show
       up on the list
    observations/AIRS/work/mkmf_convert_airs_L2:
       add comment that if you're building on yellowstone

    most important change - the postassim output location was
    incorrect.  it is now moved before posterior inflation is
    applied.  also added trace and timestamp messages around
    the places we do output, and removed a duplicate write if
    you're deferring all i/o until the end.
    
    add error checks for namelist combinations we don't
    support to filter and PMO. remove the need for 'has_cycling'
    in the namelist of filter and pmo.
    
    removed 'has_cycling' from the namelists where we had
    added it.

Author: Tim Hoar <thoar@ucar.edu>

    Removing a horribly broken routine that should never have made it out of the development branch: plot_coverage.m.
    
    Last of the observation-space matlab tools to be pruned of the third-party netCDF dependencies.

Author: Tim Hoar <thoar@ucar.edu>
Date:   Thu Feb 23 17:07:48 2017 +0000

    Removed the dependency on the thrid-part netCDF toolboxes and only use the
    native Matlab netCDF support.
    
    I learned that 'ncread' understands _FillValue, but not missing_value ...
    
    The graphics created are now consistent with lanai and the trunk. The rma versions
    were pretty old.

    Replaced a redundant 'success' status with a failure condition in
    interp_lonlat:obs_kind == KIND_SURFACE_HEIGHT.
    Simplified a latitude restriction 'failure' condition in interp_lonlat.
    Removed variable pmln from model_heights and from the call to dcz2
    since it's used only in dcz2.
    Completed the 'pressure' vs. 'log_invP' options in convert_vert.
    Missing options were allowing which_new to remain undefined in some cases.
    Removed write_model_time into dart_model_io_mod and added 'use' statement or it.
    Clarified the calculation of the seed given to init_random_seq.

    There is no need for a separate input.workshop.nml, especially
    when it had incorrect values in it! The original workshop_setup.csh
    modifies the model_nml in-between executions of pmo and filter, so
    these are still required and no single (static) input.nml can duplicate
    the behaviour.

    Merging in the rma_single_file branch back into the trunk.
    
    We have updated the rma_trunk to work with lower order models that are
    subroutine callable from inside filter.  We have also renamed some of the
    items in the namelist to be more clear (this information is in README_rma_updates.txt) :
    
    Filter and PMO can now run with multiple cycles for low order
    models. The output for this is only supported with single file
    output (members, inflation, mean, sd are all in the same file).
    
    Added matlab support for diagnostics format in lower order models.

    Replace with a version that
    1) has no svn conflicts text,
    2) has no CAM-SE procedures (but a little spurious documentation),
    3) is more consistent with DART style, and more self consistent.
    
    It does not have documentation of the model_mod changes introduced by RMA,
    but places related to that are flagged.

    There are variable attributes that help understand the context of the variables.
    The dimension and variable containing the list of ensemble sizes supported is now
    called 'ens_sizes'.
    
    Minor cleanup on formatting for the rest of the source codes.
    
    Changed the html document to reflect the intended usage of the
    sampling_error_correction_table.nc lookup table.
    
    Note that the actual values in the lookup table are a little different
    than the values in the final_full.N files, and that the assim_tools
    code does not actually use the netCDF lookup table yet.

    No longer using the obs_type variable as the basis for interpreting the
    obs_provenance strings. This is at Andy's request and OK'd by Chris.
    
    I also made it an error to use the 'IJK' locations since this is not working
    correctly, as far as I can tell. When converting the observations using IJK,
    one does not get the same locations as when the lat,lon,depth locations
    are used that come native from ROMS. The default was to not use the IJK locations,
    and I removed the namelist variable that would enable it. That variable had already
    been removed from the models/ROMS/work namelist and examples that Andy has
    been using - so there is no expected impact.
    
    Updated documentation and example namelists.

    Reintegrating the rma_cice branch to the rma_trunk.
    Note: the io_filenames_mod.f90 is in such a state of flux that it cannot be consistent
    for all models currently useful on the rma_trunk, so I'm not changing it.
    This means the models/cice scripting is not consistent with what is on the rma_trunk.
    When the file names are solidified, the scripting for many models will need to be
    revisited.

    Some attributes make no difference now that the obs_provenance comes as a

    In utlilities_mod.f90:set_filename_list() The variable for the message
    string was not long enough for the error message and it got truncated
    before reporing the useful bit.  I added a couple optional arguments
    to provide more context.
    
    It used to read:
     ERROR FROM:
      routine: convert_roms_obs
      message: found no filenames contained in a list fi
    
    now it reads:

    Turns out the string I was using to denote a successful model advance was not
    sufficient.  If the log file has a phrase like
    "Blowing-up: Saving latest model state into  RESTART file"
    the model did not complete successfully, even though the log file ends:
    "ROMS/TOMS: DONE"
    
    I turned off the prior state-space inflation in the input.nml.template file.
    This was causing our test case (with a not-very-realistic observation sequence file)
    to blow up in the 4th cycle. Compounded by the script not
    detecting the failed model advance, DART was failing with a really misleading
    error message.

    ROMS depths are negative.  Zero is the surface, the deepest parts are large negative numbers.
    The model_mod.f90 and the observation converter had the opposite convention.
    
    Since these are coded as 'heights', the bins specified in obs_diag_nml:height_edges must
    have the deepest (bottom-most) edge FIRST, with the highest(the surface) is the last.
    This feels a little counterintuitive when doing the data entry, but that's the way it goes.

    Change the input.nml so that it can run the rma_trunk.
    Change the assimilate.csh script to simply modify the POP
    restart files IN-PLACE. Since there is no file conversion
    going on, there is no need for separate directories for each
    ensemble member, nor is there a need for an assimilate directory.
    Everything just happens in the CESM RUN dir.
    
    The documentation matches the rma implementation, and has the subroutine

    The scripting changes also implement support inflation - and use the 'new' names
    that will be the defaults very soon.
    
    The input namelists have also been modified to reflect the desire to assimilate
    _all_ the observations in the obs_provenance declaration. We will have to support
    many more (changes forthcoming to the obs_def_ocean_mod.f90)

    The assimilation is working, cycling etc.
    For demonstration purposes, there is a 'safety' file created
    that is a copy of the raw roms_dai.nc file. That file can be
    diffed with the posterior file to create the increments.
    It is totally not needed for a production run since the original
    roms restart file is still created and has this same information as
    one of the time steps.
    
    The model_mod.f90 get_close_obs() needs to use the land masks.
    
    The model states also have '_FillValue' values over land,
    DART will not handle these correctly just yet. Inflation may
    get applied and alter the values etc.

    This cycles ... but does nothing with inflation files.
    The s4dvar.in.template and ocean.in.template files are here for
    archival purpose only - they are intended to be in the same directory
    as the ensemble of initial states.
    
    This is fundamentally a two step process:
    1) configure and run stage_experiment.csh
    2) cd to the experiment directory and run cycle.csh as often as you like.
       the results of the assimilation are then inserted into the ocean.in
       in preparation for the next cycle.
    
    The stage_experiment.csh script is supposed to cat out some instructions,
    but I'm going to wait till I've had a chance to discuss the setup with
    Andy and Chris before I write them.

commit 7303b1b3f6b859f23935da791b67d357cd090bdf
Author: Tim Hoar <thoar@ucar.edu>
Date:   Mon Sep 12 18:10:35 2016 +0000

    Removed the use of a single file that had some metadata that was previously
    not present in the original test files. Turns out those test files are not
    representative and it is easy to have that metadata in the original rom_obs.nc
    which then passes it on to the verification observation files.
    
    Because we can assume the verification obs files have all the required
    metadata, we can simplify the logic a bit and I have simplified the
    namelist.  I have also added the metadata to the input test data.
    
    The change to the model_mod.f90 is to remove public USE statement that
    is not needed and improved an error message about the assumptions of
    the time string units.

    The ROMS verification obs converter now subsets only those observations
    that were precomputed by ROMS - their input files can have MANY observations
    outside the window of the forecast period.
    
    Added a logical to allow for the ability to _not_ output the FO values
    and create a 'traditional' DART observation sequence file if so desired.

    move the mpi initialization calls in the filter program
    instead of leaving them in the module.  this makes it
    easier to use parts of the fortran module.

    again with the normal module.

    clean up the comments around the fortran SELECTED_KIND sections,
    including some comments from the MPI standards on how to select
    a variable of the intended number of bytes.
    
    replaced parmnamelength with varnamelength, and will be committing
    other code that uses obstypelength only for obs strings and uses
    varnamelength for things unrelated to observations.  the fortran 90/95
    standard sets the max var name length as 31 (our 'preprocess' program
    generates integer parameter variables from strings and the limit
    applies there.)  apparently fortran 2003 raises that limit to 63 but
    at this time we're sticking with 31.

    in the utilities module, update the open_file() code to support more options.
    we can now use this single routine instead of custom open() calls in other modules.
    make the error messages more specific (hopefully now more helpful).
    make it possible to return an error back to the caller for handling.
    the defaults have not changed, and without an optional argument
    this routine still fails here on error.
    
    the obs_sequence_mod now uses the updated open_file code, and does
    not try to handle "pre_I" files anymore (which can't be supported
    anyway with our current obs kind/types code).  also added a namelist
    option to read binary obs_seq files written on a different endian machine.
    
    updated the cice converter to use the open_file() code with the
    stream input format option, and fixed up the defaults in the example
    namelist so it runs with the single example obs file we supply.

    The string_to_integer() function was declared as a real. We already had one of string_to_real(),
    The function does not appear to be called anywhere in the existing DART code,
    so no exhaustive testing was performed. I just noticed it when I was trying to merge the rma_trunk
    updates to the rma_roms branch.

    fix the types of the local variables for the integer data
    versions to keep them integer.  also correct the comments
    in the query_varname() routine to be more clear about what
    this routine does.

    The observation converter for ROMS ocean obs to put them
    into DART obs_seq format.
    
    This converter is different from others in that it assumes
    the input files contain the already-evaluated forward
    operator values, output from an ensemble of ROMS models.
    
    the advantage is that the forward operators were computed
    at the time of the observation during the model run.
    
    the disadvantage is that there is no interpolation code
    in the model_mod for ROMS now, so we cannot compute the
    posterior obs values.
    
    this code is standalone, but using filter with these
    obs requires the code in the obs_def module which
    handles obs_seq files that contain precomputed forward
    operators.  (this will be committed soon but is not
    committed at this time.)

    make the default 'endian-ness' for the grid files
    big_endian, with a namelist option to set it to
    little_endian or leave as 'native'.  this means
    you can compile pop without the -convert big_endian
    compile flag, which applies to all binary (unformatted)
    files.  (it doesn't break if you have the compile flag
    set, but since the grid files are the only binary files
    being read now in the rma version, it's not needed.)
    this makes it possible to leave your mkmf.template file
    alone when compiling different models, finally.

    set the 'endian-ness' for the ocean grid files on the
    open() for those files only.  this allows the code to
    be compiled WITHOUT the -convert big-endian flag.
    
    the setting is in the &model_nml namelist, and if the
    grid files aren't big-endian it can be changed to 'native'.

    Dying in filter - finally. The scripts are getting to the filter, but there is a
    problem with something out-of-bounds. filter is core dumping on yellowstone
    with the Intel compiler with full debug on:

    I added the call to state_structure_info() and the dart_kind is not recognized.
    I ran model_mod_check with the model_nml debug level set to 1 and got:
    
     Reporting on domain #            1  created by method file
     varname     : aicen
     var_size    :       614400
     index_start :                      1
     index_end   :                 614400
     kind_string : unknown
     dart_kind   :  -1
     clamping    :  F
    
    which doesn't seem right to me.
    
    The verify_state_variables() routine checks for valid DART kinds, so something is going wrong between there and the add_domain() ... I guess.

    we can't use the cice history land mask - that's based on the
    model grid, not the observation grid.
    
    this still writes the obs_seq file a final time when it
    shouldn't - and i haven't tested looping.  but i think it
    might be working for a single input file.

    that has a single aggregate observation.  seems to work

    The stream text files should have names like the defaults, that way
    they will not get confused with the ones that get staged automatically
    (and have the default name not be used ...)
    
    The setup_pmo script actually is evolving to be able to do multiple instances
    since Fei runs an ensemble for the free run. It can be modified to run
    a single instance, so why not.
    
    Right now, the resulting job has not been run successfully, I was staging
    a CICE4 restart file for a CICE 5 run ... need an ensemble.

    the model_mod has a perturb routine, so set the amplitude
    in the &model_nml and NOT the &filter_nml.    the namelist
    is set up now to assume 3 ensemble members, names read from
    the cice_restarts.txt file.  copy the input .nc files to the
    output .nc files so we have the global attributes with the
    timestamps so they can be used as restarts for the next cycle.

    Resuscitated the distributed_phb_model_mod, to work with
    all of the current changes that have happened since it was
    written in April 2014.  It now compiles and runs.
    
    NOTE: distrib_phb_mod.f90 uses pnetcdf to distribute the data
    across tasks.  This requires using PNETCDF in the mkmf.template
    file, and including utilities/pnetcdf_utilities_mod.f90 in the
    path names.

    Bringing up-to-date with respect to the trunk:
    
    Correctly setting the QC values for the (computed) *HORIZONTAL_WIND metrics.
    Previous version were not honoring the incoming qc value and so the
    number of possible observations was getting over-reported.
    
    This version is a little closer to the style guide requirements
    and reinstates some of the indenting that got hosed with commit 10348.
    
    This version also can be used with obs_seq.in and obs_seq.out files
    in a limited fashion.  The number of observations in each region, the
    observation value for the region, the incoming QC for the obs in the regions,
    and the summary of what types are actually in the file are all useful -
    even if you do not have the prior/posterior quantities.
    
    Removed some debug code that was causing problems (i.e. a fatal error) when people
    input the _edges arrays as opposed to the midpoints to define the vertical binning.
    When obs_diag supported the use of the _edges, I had code in to check to make sure
    the new algorithm generated the correct answer under all circumstances.  The old
    algorithm did not work when the user specified the _edges. However, the test that
    was inadvertently left in was to check to make sure the old level index matched
    the new level index (a good thing if you specify the midpoints,
    a bad thing if you specify the edges).
    
    The new algorithm has been working for years now, time to remove the debug code.

    Merging in CM1 branch into the rma_trunk.  Additional
    changes have been made to the path_names_* in order
    for quickbuild to sucessfully compile for bgrid_solo,
    cam, cm1, lorenz_96, mpas_atm, POP, ROMS and wrf.
    
    Allocating 1d arrays instead of 2d arrays for forward,
    and mean copies.  This is so Openmpi 1.10.0 will compile
    and run.
    
    Adding KIND_SURFACE_TEMPERATURE
           KIND_2M_TEMPERATURE
           KIND_10M_U_WIND_COMPONENT
           KIND_10M_V_WIND_COMPONENT
    to the DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90.  These are specific to CM1.
    
    Changed the default preprocess namelist for wrf to match the
    DART trunk. This is useful for bitwise testing when comparing
    for bitwise tests.
    
    Added the option to make cam filter with mpi and nompi.

    Bug Fix 1 (wrf/model_mod.f90) : Using the correct type to grab
    variable size in nc_write_model_atts for types w and gz. When
    no variable type_w is present and type_gz is present then attributes
    were grabbing type information exclusively from type_w to calculate sizes
    which may not present.  This was causing filter to crash when writting
    attributes since type_w is not defined.
    
    Bug Fix 2 (wrf/model_mod.f90) : Using my_index instead of ind to
    find variable size in nc_write_model_atts. This is only a problem
    if you are using multiple domains that contain different variables.

Date:   Tue May 10 23:20:45 2016 +0000

    Adding a basic unit test for all of the subroutines in
    state_structure_mod.f90.  This test adds 5 domains :
    2 from blank, 2 from file and one from a spec.
    
    Small errors in the state structure were found such as
    setting uninitalized variables, calculating start and
    end index properly with mixed domains, using the correct
    filename size of 256. Also removed static_init_state_type()
    which was easily replaced by initializing the state_structure
    variables.
    
    Added some error checking for using routines that are specific
    to adding domains from spec, namely add_dimension_to_variable and
    finished_adding_domain. If multiple variable ids are found given a
    kind then get_varid_from_kind now fails rather than return the
    first variable. Final check to make sure that we have a valid domain_id
    when using variables from the state structure.

Author: Johnny Hendricks <Johnny>
Date:   Tue Apr 12 17:44:42 2016 +0000

    Adding some of the more commonly used CF-Conventions to
    files created from scratch, and appending global attributes
    to file who have variables that are clamped.  The
    CF-Conventions that we will include are
    
     * units
     * long_name
     * short_name
     * _FillValue
     * missing_value
     * add_offset
     * scale_factor
    
    If these variables exist we will store them in the state structure
    and use this information when writting files.
    
    Note: add_offset and scale_factor are not supported at the moment,
    and your program will crash.  This is because we need to unpack and
    pack the data properly.  Currently no models use scale factor or
    offset.
    
    Inflation and Standard Deviation Files do not include clamping
    information.
    
    One additional feature is having a global DART_file_information
    string used to describe the file, and a DART_note for the mean
    and standard deviation mentioning that the values were computed
    prior to clamping. Additionally revision, rev. date and create date
    are included in the global attributes.

    component directions are where the wind is going to.

    people to alter when reading observation data that comes to
    them in ascii file format.

    These where skeleton routines previously.
    These routines are used to write the STATE variables to Prior and
    Posterior Diagnostic files if desired by a model_mod. They are used
    in the same way as nc_write_model_atts and nc_write_model_vars, i.e.
    called in init_diag_output and in aoutput_diagnostics.
    Note the model_mod can write other info to the Prior and Posterior
    diagnostic files during nc_write_model_atts, e.g its input_nml or
    static data and still have DART write the state variables.
    
    A diagnostic domain was added to the state stucture. This is so
    you can combine multiple domains into one diagnostic file.
    This domain is 'hidden' after the maximum number of domains so
    it is not counted as part of the state, but all the domain,
    variable and dimension accessor functions can be used on it to
    write netdcf files. The tests used to develop the diagnostic
    domain are in io/tests.  There is an assert module that may be
    of use in other tests.
    
    Code corrections:
    source, revision, revdate was missing from some E_ERR calls,
    these have been added.
    Removed the optional argument from lorenz_96/model_mod
    nc_write_model_vars. Never used this, it was left over from
    refactoring IO.

    Merging in rma_cam_fv branch to rma_trunk.
    
    Chages from the trunk version of cam/model_mod.f90:
    
    * This model_mod now only supports cam_fv.
    * Cam SE code has been removed.
    * The global arrays ps(:,:), ps_stagr_lon(:,:), ps_stagr_lat(:,:) have
      been removed and replaced by a function get_surface_pressure. This is to
      reduce the amount of static data. Also to build these arrays on each task
      with a distributed state requires communication on all tasks.
    * The global arrays p_col and model_h have been removed. They are allocated
      on demand to the required number of levels.  This is for code safety as it
      allows you to use bounds checking on p_col and model_h.
    * LARGE CHANGE:  I have removed the reordering of variables.  The trunk
      reorders variables into a given lon, lat order and reorders 3D variables to
      so columns are together in the state.  This reordering has been totally
      removed because:
         1.  The state is distributed so the model_mod can make no sensible
             decision on how to arrange the state vector. The assimilation controls
             this (for good reason - load balancing).
         2.  Removing the lon lat reording allows cam to make use of the state_structure_mod
             and netcdf IO.
       The dimension order of the netcdf file was being stored in f_dim*. s_dim* was the
       reordered dimensions.  I have replaced s_dim with f_dim ( I assume f means file and
       s means state).
         prog_var_to_vector, vector_to_prog_var, read_cam_init, write_cam_init all use f_dim.
       BE AWARE: you cannot use trunk converters (dart_to_cam, cam_to_dart) with dart restart
       files from the rma_trunk (and vise versa)
    
    
    To do:
       * Finding the lon, lat, lev dimension names for a variable is done on demand in
         model_interpolate and get_index_from_grid.  This could be done upfront in
         static_init_model for each variable in the state.
    
       * I don't think HybridA and HybridB change throughout a run of filter so these
         do not need to be calculated every time model_heights is called.
    
       * There is a comment in Line 3409 (line 5053 in the trunk) about using the updated
         state to call model_heights.  The state is either an ensemble member during the
         forward operator (state not updated between forward operators) or it is the mean
         state passed to the model before assimilation (not updated during assimilation).
         This may be irrelevant now model_h is no longer global.  Or it may be that we are
         recalulcating something that stays constant. Or the comment may be irrelevant.
         It is something to be aware of because the intent of the comment does not match
         what is happening in the code.
    
       * IMPORTANT: The calculation of highest_obs_height will use the surface pressure at
         a different location on each task for the distributed forward operator. See
         JIRA ticket DARTSUP-307. This is unsolved.
    
       * Pert_model_copies is written but untested.  It will not be bitwise with the trunk
         because of the state reordering (the random number order it different relative to
         dart index). You could recreate the state reordering if you wanted.

    Bug fix:  in track_status in non debug mode the istatus for passing ensemble members was not being updated.
    The check_forward_operator_istatus subroutine compares istatus and the forward operator result.  missing_r8 and status = 0 is not allowed.
    So if in track status you are setting all val_data(:) you should set any 0 istatuses to 1.

    merging rma_state_structure_test_dir back into the rma_trunk.
    
    Added test directory within io that contains a work directory where
    you can build and compile test code. Test code files are located in
    the test directory and build scripts are located in the work directory
    along with a quick_build.csh which will compile all of the programs.
    This is similar to the utilities test directory.
    
    This contains a template for testing the state structure. Currently
    this program just reads a namelist.  This program is a starting point
    for unit testing for the state_structure_mod.
    
    Also added in this branch is simple read write restart test program.

    Merging in rma_refrac_io branch.
    State io is moved to state_vector_io_mod.  It is moved from
    assim_model_mod, ensemble_manager, adaptive_inflate_mod.
    
    Filenames:
    io_filenames_mod no longer has a namelist. The io options are passed in from above to
    io_filenames_init. This allows filter and perfect model obs to use the same input.nml.
    
    State space diagnostics:
    Moved state_space_diagnostics to state_space_diag.  There is an namelist option to skip
    making diangostic files - this is for high resoltion models such as tenth degree POP.
    The info is written out as separate netcdf files.
    The diangostic calls init/finalize are now called by all tasks. This allows future
    parallel writes and current 1 task per files writes.
    nc_write_model_atts has a new arguement which is used to communicate to state_space_diag
    whether the model_mod will write the state variables or let dart write the state variables.
    This allows the model_mod to write whatever it needs to the diagnostic file. Note dart writing
    diagnostic files is not supported yet there are just hooks in the code.
    Some routines are only used by rms_diag.f90.  These need to be resurrected if rms_diag.f90 is
    needed.
    
    State IO:
    read_state and write_state are the interfaces for filter and perfect_model_obs.
    The copy meta data (e.g. ENS_MEAN_COPY) is now in copies_on_off_mod. This is to removed
    the hardcoded copy numbers in io_filenames_mod. You may want to move this meta data elsewhere,
    e.g. io_filenames_mod or ensemble manager. The number of extra copies is set in filter_mod using
    set_state_copies. Currently this is 6 or 12.
    Note there is no check for time consistancy across netdf files (netcdf read).  Only ensemble
    member 1's time is used.
    
    Inflation IO:
    Moved state space inflation IO out of adaptive_inflate_mod. Added more information to the
    inflation handle about the IO options so they can be queried for state IO. Added 'prior' or
    'posterior' to the handle. Not sure if there is any danger doing this so be aware.
    
    Perturbation:
    Perturbation is now separate from IO.  The namelist option is in filter: perturb_from_single_instance.
    Perturbation is done copy complete in pert_model_copies. If filter does the perturb it is bitwise
    across tasks (note that this is SLOW). Model perturbs I have kept bitwise with Lanai/Trunk (note SLOW),
    i.e. bitwise across tasks if task_count >= ens_size, bitwise for the same number of tasks if
    ens_size < task_count.
    
    MPI utilities:
    Added all_reduce_min_max (for perturbing)
    Added broadcast_flag to broadcast a logical across tasks (for nc_write_model_atts)

    merging rma_kinds_to_state_structure back to the rma_trunk.
    
    * notable changes *
    
     - included in this branch is an optional argument to include
       kind and update information through the add_domain call.
    
     - separated io variable information and model variable information.
       routines that only perform io specific operations are named
       get_io_* and do_io_* to avoid confusion between model_mod use
       of state_structure information and IO use.
    
        -> netcdf dimension ids are stored in io_information while are
           sequential indicies starting from 1 to the number of dimensions
           defined for a particular variable.
    
      - update information is optionaly passed into add_domain and used in
        transpose_write.  the default is to update all variables.
    
    
    * minor changes *
    
     - new accessor functions for harvesting kind information from specified
       domain and variable id.
    
     - return variable id given a domain and dart kind.
       this may either a single id or a list of ids depending the model
       and if it chooses to use the same kind for multiple variables
    
        -> get_num_varids_from_kind returns the number of variables associated
           with a specified kind within a domain.
    
     - renaming get_index1 and get_indexN to more descriptive
       get_index_start and get_index_end.
    
     - added copyright information to the top of modules in the io directory.

    Bug fix:  wrf model_mod.
    Fixes Jira issue DARTSUP-295
    For cases where different variables are in different domains the wrong index was being used to access wrf%dom%.
    This did not cause a problem when the same variables were used in each domain because my_index = ind.

    this was reviewed eons ago and i never committed it to
    the trunk because of the difficulty of integrating it
    with all the path_names_xxx files - basically being in
    its own module and having the code called from assim_tools
    means any program using assim_tools needs this module
    added to the path_names_xxx file - plus 2 other modules
    that this module needs.
    
    for now i haven't committed the assim_tools that
    calls the impact factor code, but i'm putting these
    files into the repo so they don't get lost.

    two changes:  first, the intel compiler was unhappy
    about specifying val_pressure(ens_size) as the function
    result value before ens_size was declared (it is an
    argument to this function) in get_val_pressure().
    the "fix" was just to move it below the declaration
    line for ens_size.
    
    second, fix another array out-of-bounds if you have
    specified noise_sd > 0 in the namelist. the code looped
    from 1 to size(array) but the actual index bounds go
    from 0 to size-1 (or more if the halo size is > 1).
    the fix is to use lbound() and ubound() to get the
    lower and upper index values.  these loops will
    include the halo region; if you want to operate
    only on the interior of the array you'd have to
    get is,ie; js,je; ks,ke from the bgrid derived types.

    General clean up of state_strucutre_mod.  No major code changes.
    This is mostly to have consistency for variables throughout the
    state_structure, and for readability.
    
    General clean up includes:
      * Updated comments where needed
      * Reordered public list to be in a more logical order
      * Removed unused variables
      * Renamed variables
        - any variable with fortran intrinsic function names to
          be something else (ex. size -> dom_size).
        - where appropriate gave more information to variable names.
      * Added Doxygen comments above subroutines and functions.

    rma_model_mod_check branch merged onto the rma_trunk.
    
    New model_mod_tools directory with a generic
    model_mod_check, that can be used by any model.
    
    Currently the model_mod_check has 5 tests that you can run
    
    1. Running static_init_model to get model_size
    2. Read and write restart files
    3. Test get_state_meta_data on a single location
    4. Test model_interpolate on a single location
    5. Test model_interpolate on a range of locations
    
    You also have the flexibility of running with multiple restarts,
    which did not exist in previous versions of model_mod_check.
    
    There are three test_interpolate modules for different types of
    locations that can be used in a model_mod.  The new modules are
    in the model_mod_tools directory:

    Added the option to have POP variables be defined in
    the model_nml, rather than hard-coded into the model_mod.
    
    Variables can be defined with
      model_state_variables = 'netcdf_var1', 'dart_kind', 'update',
                              'netcdf_var2', 'dart_kind', 'update',
                              ...
    
    If no model_state_variables list is provided, the default
    (SALT_CUR, TEMP_CUR, UVEL_CUR, VVEL_CUR, PSURF_CUR) netcdf
    variables will be used.
    
    Diagnostic files only output the default variables.  This is
    because there is no attribute information for additional variables
    that could be added to the state.  This can be upgraded in the
    future if there exists a need.
    
    Currently the update option is not being used, but was put
    in for convinience for when update information is added to
    the state_structure.
    
    Removed the print_range subroutine as it no longer is trivial
    to calculate min and max values with a distributed state.

    rma_clm branch merged onto the trunk.
    
    Doing this now (rather than when rma_clm is finished) since the forward operators
    for clm require both the state time and the global ensemble index. These were not
    in the rma_trunk.
    
    New code:
    * The current time has been added to the ensemble_handle.  This is
    set in filter_sync_keys_time.
    * Obs_defs now have access to the global ensemble indices.
    
    Small changes:
    Made ens_size a variable in perfect_model_obs (=1)
    Name change in fowrard operator mod: my_ensemble_copies => num_copies_to_calc
    
    Doxygen changes:
    - Only generate diagrams for source code when -devel flag is used.
    
    Note dart_to_clm and clm_to_dart have been removed so you have to read directly from
    netcdf. Changed pathnames and mkmfs in the clm work directory to compile with mpi/no mpi
    and rma code.

    Merging in the rma_obs_def branch to the rma_trunk.
    
    New code: obs_def_utilities_mod
      * utilities that can be used in obs_defs.
      * track_status keeps track of failed istatuses for multiple calls to
        model_interpolate.  Track status returns a logical (return_now) which tells
        the calling code whether it can return early from obs_def.
        There are two ways of using track status:
        1. As soon as any forward operator fails,  return_now = .true. since you are
           not going to assimilate the observarion anyway
        2. Keep track of failing forward operators, but continue until finished all
           forward operators.  Note if all forward operators fail, return_now = .true.
        Whether option 1 or 2 is used depends on set_debug_fwd_op(output_forward_op_errors).
        Called in filter_mod.
        To be bitwise with the Trunk (and the rma_trunk prior to this commit) set
        output_forward_op_errors = .true.  Otherwise option 2 is used and the obs_def will exit
        as soon as 1 ensemble member fails.
        Note that this 'bailing out at first failure' is possible because the forward operators
        are applied multiple ensemble members simultaneously by the same task.
        *** The non-bitwise changes are only in obs_seq.final. *** Opion 1 will have -88888 for
        all ensemble members (if one or more ensemble members failed), while Option 2 will have
        -88888 for only the failed ensemble members.
    
    New directory obs_def/test - test data for forward operators
    
    Style changes: - to conform to the DART style guide and to remove _distrib from routines
    The _distrib was left over from when both the trunk routines and the rma rouintes were in the
    same source code.
       * removed _distrib
       * changed order of arguments so return arguments are at the end, istatus last.
       * passing the number of ensemble members (this could be from 1 to ens_size) instead of using
         assumed size arrays.
    
    Lorenz_96 has been reordered.  Note dom_id has gone from a module global to a local variable in
    static_init_model.  Beware it needs to be global if you use it elsewhere.
    
    Mpi_utitiles:
      * Collapsed mpi_reduce_min max so datasize is passed to the routine rather than having an
        mpi_real and and mpi_real8 version.
      * Added note to programmers about openmpi 1.10.0 - I believe this was a bug that is fixed in
        openmpi 1.10.1 (2D arrays and scalars where not being allowed in mpi calls when compiling
        with ifort 16)

Author: kershaw-dart <Helen>
Date:   Thu Oct 15 17:34:23 2015 +0000

    Single processor (compile and run without mpi) option added.
    
    
    Get State:
    For a single processor the state and mean are always distributed no matter
    what the namelist options for 'distributed_state' and 'distribute_mean'. get_state
    always accesses %copies because for a single processor, the processor owns every state element.
    get_fwd or get_mean (the mpi_window calls) are never accessed because the single processor never
    needs to get something from another task. The state and mean non-transposable (transpose_type = 1).
    
    get_fwd and get_mean are in mpi_utilities_mod.  For mpi_utils they actually call mpi_get. In
    null_mpi_utils they error out since they should never be called (they are only called if a process
    is not the owner of a state element).
    
    Netcdf IO:
    A single processor version of read_transpose and transpose_write is in direct_netcdf_no_mpi.
    Previously this was a dummy module that allowed you to compile but was never used since filter and perfect_model_obs
    were always compiled with mpi.
    
    Single process reads/writes one copy at a time so space for one copy is allocated, rather than calling all_copies_to_all_vars.
    Note the mpi versions of read_transpose and transpose_write are isolated in their own module.  The mpi version uses mpi_groups
    and I want to keep this isolated for now.
    
    Null window mod:
    There is a null_win_mod for single processor code.  Note the window mod is on its own rather than in distributed_state because
    there is a cray_window_mod and a non_cray_window mod.
      create_state_window only sets the data_count - needed when get_state accesses %copies
      create_mean_window always uses a distributed mean.  To put the mean on every processor would just be doubling the data for the
        single processes.
    
    Mkmfs:
    For mpi/non-mpi programs (filter, perfect_model_obs, wakeup_filter). Path names are changed for:
     1. win_mod.f90  The default is to use the no_cray_window since gfortran does not support cray pointers (this
    bug may be fixed in future gfortran releases).
     2. mpi/null_mpi
     3. direct_netcdf_mpi/no_mpi
    
    Perfect_model_obs:
    Uses transpose type 2 for QC and forward operator handles so they can be transposed.
    
    
      Problems/todo list:
      1. There is duplicate code for create_state_output
                                     write_variable
                                     write_variable_clamp
                                     read_variable
                                     clamp_variable
      in direct_netcdf_mpi/no_mpi.  These five routines will go in their own module shortly so they can be used by mpi and non-mpi versions.
    
      2. There are programs that call get_state_meta_data to get the kind for an index.  WRF and MPAS do the vertial conversion in
         get_state_meta_data. Programs need to initialize an ensemble or call a routine that only returns the kind - or another solution.
    
      3. Info about clamped variables is only printed on task 0 (E_MSG), but clamping may be done by other tasks.

    Merging changes from rma_trunk_clamping onto the rma_trunk.
    
    Removed do_clamp_or_fail and clamp_or_fail_it routines from
    the model_mod.  Variable bounds are now stored in the
    state_structure, with an optional argument to the add_domain
    call and clamping is done within the IO module.

commit 4ea2a2b13f7402e0ff6c1a55e059b26dd3f20c36
Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Fri Oct 2 21:59:38 2015 +0000

    correct the perturb copies routine to only perturb the
    ensemble memeber, move the check for missing_r8 inside a
    logical so it only gets executed if missing values are possible.
    remove some unused local variables.
    
    still to be done:  1) figure out where this code actually belongs
    and move it there.  2) there are 3 different namelists which have
    a perturb amplitude.  3) the filter namelist now has both
    'start_from_restart' and 'perturb_restarts'.  i'll agree that
    'perturb_restarts' is much more helpful a name, but then we
    should remove 'start_from_restart' because it implies doing
    the same thing. 4) the call to the model perturb routine should
    at least get the ensemble size.  5) we should give an example
    of how to perturb variable by variable, or allow different
    amplitudes by variable or something as a template for people
    to follow if they do have specialized perturbation needs.

    Merged in changes from branches/rma_trunk_null_mpi.
       * path names & mkmf changes to remove unnecessary mpi dependence.
       * mpi_utilities mpi_reduce_min_max
       * For programs that run var complete you have to initialize ensemble handle with transpose_type  = 2 (transposable - allocates %vars array)
       * read_transpose/transpose_write moved into its own module.  There is a non-mpi version of this that is just empty.  This will be the single core version of read_transpose/transpose_write. i.e. direct from netcdf to %copies. No need for limit mem or limit procs - if you can't read it all at once you are not running anyway.
       * several use statements changed from assim_model_mod to state_vector_io_mod for reading and writing.
       * Got rid of null_vert_convert_mod and null_clamp_mod.  This just seemed to confuse people no end.  You now have to put code in each model mod for the clamp and vert_convert routines (same same same in each model_mod)
    
    At the moment there is a null version of distributed_state_mod.  This will go away shortly - rolling mpi_win_lock .. get .. unlock into mpi_utilities_mod.
    
    I have not updated the CAM pathnames and mkmfs. This model mod needs work anyway. So current models are
    lorenz_96, bgrid_solo, mpas_atm (this needs looking at), WRF and POP.
    
    io/dart_time_io_mod.f90 is still knocking around.  Not sure what to do with this.

    Merging in rma_trunk_vert_loc.  Added _mod to module names null_clamp and null_vert_convert
    get_vert, set_vet, get_which_vert now in location mod.

    Single source:
       * can do forward operators var complete or copy complete
       * can do vert convert with distributed mean or mean on each processor
    These are run time options (filter_nml and assim_tools_nml)
    Model_mod interfaces are the same in this commit.  Interfaces from rma_ss_model_mods will come soon.
    This is a function rather than a subroutine for get_state. Also get_mean becomes an array.
    
    New code:
       * ensemble_type now has a transpose_type:
           1. distributed only
           2. transposable
           3. transpose and duplicate - this is for the mean on each processor.
    
       * Forward operator mod has the largest change. Giant if statment at the moment to do
         either state complete or copy complete forward operator. Additional qc copy added to
         deal with assim_this_ob, eval_this_ob.  Filter keeps the prior_qc_copy.  This is to avoid
         transposing forwards and backwards just to store the prior_qc.
    
       * mean_ens_handle created in window_mod. This keeps the memory and window together. Uses a
         transpose distribute when each processor gets a copy of the mean.
    
       * Filter mod is still quite ugly with allocating and dealloacting state_ens_handle%vars for
         reading/writing state, inflation advancing the model.
    
    Still to do:
       * The rma_ss_model_mods branch has the set_vert, get_vert routines moved into location_mod.  This
         needs doing consistantly across the 1d,2d,etc. location_mods and the rma supported models.
       * Function version of get_state.  Note this is not a straight transfer from rma_ss_model_mods because
         it is not safe to pass out the mean_ens_handle

    Rejoined ensemble_manager_mod and data_structure_mod.  Data_structure_mod no longer exists.  data_structure_mod was made to avoid the circular dependency model_mod -> ensemble_manager_mod -> model_mod. I have removed this circular dependency by removing IO from ensemble_manager_mod and from assim_model_mod.  This IO (for regular old dart files - time + state vector) is now in state_vector_io_mod.
    
    Put back in the option to write diagnostic files.  Spare copies are not written if you do this. Diagnostic file write is in its own module (the init_diag, etc. is still in assim_model_mod for now). There is a skeleton diagnostic routine that will probably be deprecated. Do we need a diagnostic write that can make a diagnostic file from state_structure_mod?

    Making a duplicate of the state%copies array in the window module.  This is the safe option for now, since we cannot have a guarantee of pass by reference (see earlier commits about function vs. subroutine create_mean_window).  The downside is duplicating the first ens_size rows of the copies array.  Speed wise this does not seem to make a difference for a regular wrf case. However memory usage in Giant POP is a problem (this is why we originally stripped out the duplication).  Have to think about whether we want to keep the state%copies in a storage module or not worry because it is scalable and fix the static data first. We have always duplicated the mean data because we have to have simply contiguous memory in the window.
    
    There are two commented out functions in distributed_state_mod. These are for accessing the local window on a task. Currently we can access state%copies because this is static during the forward operator and the mean copy is not updated in filter_assim. => state%copies = same as in window.

    Added dart_time_mod in io folder - read and write dart time to netcdf file.  These routines should go somewhere more sensible like state_vector_io_mod. These routines are used in netcdf restarts (e.g. lorenz_96, bgrid_solo), but also
    may end up used in non-model specific state diagnostic files.

commit f6ac3db81ddc7e609094e373fd35580a9946f36b
Author: kershaw-dart <Helen>
Date:   Mon Jul 20 20:59:34 2015 +0000

    Updated lorenz_96 to work with the latest rma_trunk. i8 (large model support), pathnames(forward operator module), pert_model_copies.  At some point soon pert_model_copies should go in ensemble_manager_mod not filter_mod.
    Added state_ensemble handle to arguments for get_my_obs_loc.  This is so you can call get_state_meta_data to get the location for identity obs.  get_state_meta_data needs the ensemble handle because wrf does the vertical conversion of the state in get_state_meta_data so calls get_state.

Author: Johnny Hendricks <Johnny>

    Added get_state_indices to state_structure_mod.
    This routine takes a DART index and returns the
    local variable indices, variable and domain id's.
    This calculation is common to many models.
    POP, wrf, cam, mpas_atm are updated to use the new
    subroutine. Added starting and ending indices for
    the variables to the state_structure as well as an
    unlimDimID.
    
    Bug fix for io_filenames_mod which makes it possible
    to read restart pointer files with directory locations.

    subversion history from the trunk for these new added files.

    Same as commit 8058 on Lanai
    
    Performance fix: Reordered the check for missing_r8 in the state during filter_assim. Now only checking for missing_r8 if allow_missing_in_clm = .true. Note there is a debugging option in update_from_obs_inc if you need to check for missing in state at every update. In running an mpas (r4) test case the reordered version completes the sequential obs do loop in about half the time of the previous version.

    State structure module added to rma_trunk. This is to store enough netcdf meta data so any task can read and write restarts and make queries about variable shapes and sizes. It will be used to support multi-component reads - see branches/xcesm_netcdf  for an example of this (xcesm is not implemented in RMA yet). Note CAM needs an add domain call.  Currently only implemented for single time-step filter runs and does not support start, count, stride reads or scale factors or offset.  The domain identifier passed back to the model is an integer.  We should think about whether this should be an identifier_type and what should be in there.

    Modified wrf, cam, and mpas_atm state size elements
    to be i8.  All the models compile without warning with
    intel, pgi, and gfortran.  These models still need to be
    tested to make sure there is no strange bugs.

    Put in i8s for offset.  Note that ifort was only giving a warning for this.  gfortran gave an error.  Also removed kmu_sum - this was a relic from checking how much of the state is ocean. (not as much as you would like).

Author: Johnny Hendricks <Johnny>
Date:   Tue May 19 23:00:43 2015 +0000

    Changed model_size to be an i8 integer rather than
    i4, to accomodate for large models. The model size
    is directly associated with, state_index variables,
    var_list, and num_vars.  Changes were made to the
    appropriate to modules to account for the difference.
    
    Still need to update CAM, MPAS and WRF model_mod's
    to have i8 model_size (comming soon).
    
    Also in this commit I added an extension for POP's
    construct_file_name_in and used the existing
    get_pop_restart_filename for info_file_name for
    convinence.

    Setting pathnames to use no_cray_win_mod so cray pointers are not default.  This is because gfortran is our default compiler and there is a bug in gfortran 4.9.0 see https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=63529.  Need to revisit this when we use fortran 2003 standard, since that takes away cray pointers anyway.

    now POP is the only model with a model specific perturb
    routine, and wrf, cam and mpas_atm all have null interfaces
    for compiling.  Namelist parameters perturb_restarts, and
    perturbation_amplitude were added to initalize these routines.

    Bitwise netcdf cam.  Commit 7920 was nonsense - the bug was in get_state_meta_data_distrib.  This commit is a short term fudge for the rma branch to allow netcdf read/writes so XCESM IO can be developed using a CAM-FV test case.  It will be revisited shortly to be made more robust. Do not use this version for anything else. You can not read binary restart files with this - the state will be in the wrong order.  To use RMA and binary files go back to version 7898  (or write a converter for the RMA branch).

    CAM netcdf read write. Do not use this. I don't think the netcdf read creates the state vector in the same order as cam_to_dart, so the index needs changing.  There may be other problems also.  There is a fudge at the moment when creating netcdf files.  The code is currently sensitive for 'time' vs 'Time'.  Needs fixing.

Author: kershaw-dart <Helen>

    obs in height (testing with gps obs).  I believe the problem with the statuses was from model_heights_distrib_fwd. This routine is only supposed to give back an instatus of 0 or 1 (see comment in trunk version), not pass back a vstatus of 2. Lots of debuting print stuff in this.  Will be pulled out in the next commit.

    Two part bug fix: typo in query_vert_localization_coord. Check that vert coordinate is not already in the required one before calling convert vert.  If you call convert_vert with the vert you want it comes back with missing_r8 and missing_I.  Is this what is supposed to do?

    Bug fix: was not setting old_which in vert_convert_distrib. The posterior forward operators are quite different when lanai_bitwise is switched off.  Need to investigate further to see if this is due to the different number of set/get locations or a bug.

    Bitwise distributed forward operator cam-fv my machine. Only tested with observations with pressure as the vertical - need to get other obs to test.  Over-communicating at the moment, should only get values on distinct levels.  The track status stuff is ugly. Note this will need to be done for get_val_height_distrib.

    RMA version of MPAS.  Note that there is no reconstruction of u edge winds in the direct netcdf write stuff.  So for now you have to write dart restarts if you want to use the reconstructed u edge winds (u,v or increments). Also added GPS_PRECIPITABLE_WATER (used by Soyoung).

    Bug fix:  Allocate a global block of memory to stick the window to. This happens already in cray_win_mod.f90 because you have to create a cray pointer and duplicate your data.  Note for the future: The window object can happily be pointed to a deallocated piece of memory so watch out.  The MPI standard specifies that the memory the window points to has to be contiguous (or even 'simply contiguous').

    Shoved filter in a module.  I think this is fine.  Allows test code to be written using subroutines in filter_mod.f90.   Only changed wrf path names at the moment.  Also changed the default path names (i.e. whatever is in the repository) to use no_cray_win_mod.f90 since gfortran seems to not support cray pointers (I may be missing something).

    Put copies_on_off_mod from Netcdf-io branch into the RMA branch. Added prior files writing if the number of output state members is > 0. Uses filenames arrays with prior posterior (same as netcdf-io branch) Uses spare copies if no actual members are written out. Added subroutine set_num_extra_copies.  This is so the copies_in_window routines can know how many actual ensemble members there are and which one is the mean row. (Maybe we should pass mean_row the mean index).

    Part way through fixing creation of time dimension.  Bug fix: should have been updating copy_dimIds not dimIds.  Todo: Unlimited dimension needs to go at the end. Bug fix: netcdf_input = .true. needs to be in read_tranpose (where every task can set it).  May pull this out anyway.

    Removed output inflation from namelist.  There was no separate option for prior and posterior inflation in the diagnostic files. This is not complete yet. What options should be in the namelist?  I have set the default value of no_complete_state = .true. in ensemble manager.  I am unsure if this flag is necessary at all.  Adaptive inflation now can cope with regular DART inflation files (one file, both copies) or the netcdf inflation files. Can now call advance_state (requires a transpose) so you can run multi-time step lorenz_96. Next step is multi-timestep netcdf files. get_model_time stup added for lorenz_96. io_copies_on_off_mod.f90 added to path_names_filter

    Bug fix for state_vector_io_mod.f90.   It is not safe to assume that the variable id are consistence across restart files.  So now storing the list of state variable names in the module and using nf90_inq_varid to get the variable if from the restart file for each read or write. This list will need to be 2d if we allow domains to have different set of state variables.  Changed warning in wrf model_mod.f90.  I have not had any data use this part of the code.  There is far too much communication in it.

    Bug fix for ensemble manager ( see version 7184 Lanai ).  Added spare copies for prior_diag information. Added 4 spare copies at the moment. Probably, we only need 1 ( inflation mean ).  I'm not sure of the best way of creating the filenames mainly because of the domains.

    Tidied filenames for inflation copies.  Reading/Writing is turned on and off in adaptive_inflate_init and adaptive_inflate_end just like Lanai version.  Assumes you are reading everything from netcdf files which are the same as model netcdf restart files.

    Distributed forward operator for POP.  Bit wise on Yellowstone for salinity and temperature obs ( from Alicia's case ).  Other observations will need testing.  Carrying around the 'offset' since in the Lanai release the interpolation assumes you are giving it the correct slab and does horizontal interpolation.  This is probably overly complicated for the distributed version, which uses get_state. Could benefit from a function dart_index(lon, lat, height) so the messing around with offset is in one place.  The info_file_name is hardcoded (as in WRF).  Need a better solution to this. I've just looped around quad_bilinear_interp, maybe it is better to vectors this. temp_status = status bug, flipped around. Watch out for these.

    Pulled out multiple domains at once (this needs to be cleaned up in test code before being put back in).  io_filenames_mod.f90 is where all the state filenames are stored. The namelist options fill up two arrays restart_files_in/out(copy, domain) so state_vector_io_mod can pull up the filename for a given copy & domain. The namelist option is just a list of files at the moment (in order).  There is no doubt a better way to do this, but this module should be all that needs changing.

    Partial code for transpose_write multiple domains at once.  Do not run this code.  I'm going to back out of multiple domains at once and make sure the io filenames module is tidy. Multiple domain read/write should/will go in a test harness so we can test IO in isolation.

    Problem calling round_robin_limit_procs: the number of copies is different of each ensemble, so you end up with different my_vars. .  The rest off the code assumes that the vars are on the same tasks for each ensemble.  I don't think there is a need for each ensemble to have its own layout, so I may strip out the ensemble dependence. For now, back to regular round_robin while I tidy the IO filenames.

    Moved layout around to accommodate multiple readers ( limit_procs < task_count).  With the regular round robin you can end up with multiple readers per node.  Stuffed limit_procs into ensemble manager namelist.  Not sure if this is the best place for it to go. Also, ensemble_manager has to know about the number of domains to organize this layout. Moved setting #vars and #copies to before layout call, as #copies is needed.  Currently using the routine round_robin_limit_procs, this could be rolled back into round_robin.  Now reading all domains at once. writing is still serial.  Need to test the speed/efficiency of this.  More readers vs. longer transpose loop.  Currently transposing the domains in ascending size order, does this make a difference?

    Read transpose, multiple domains at once.  Set up to transpose domains in ascending size order.  Need to test if this makes a difference.  Using a function to calculate starting point in state_ens_handle%copies for the receiving pe.  I think this function could be used if you read multiple variables at once (ensemble x variable readers).  Read_transpose is untested with multiple groups.  The my_copy - recv_start is what is untested.  Note this is just reading at the moment.  transpose_write is still domains in a loop.

    Inflation files, direct netcdf read or regular single file way. The way inflation filenames for netcdf are constructed is really ugly. Turning copies on/off for writing restarts and inflation files. Next step is to tidy up input options.

    Removed hardcoded file names from state_vector_io_mod and filter. Now querying the model for the filenames. For lorenz_96 the model doesn't do anything with file names, so restart_in_file_name & restart_out_file_name (filter_nml) are passed to read_transpose.  WRF ignores these and constructs wrfinput_d0* and whatever else it needs. At the moment, lorenz_96 has the filename functions in model_mod.  I think these might as well go in a null module that all the small models can use.

    Lorenz_96 and wrf vertical stuff (%vloc) sorted out in assim_tools_mod. Both bitwise my machine. Can't advance lorenz_96 yet.  Not sure whether to just transpose. TIME is broken still. FILENAMES in state_vector_io_mod are hard coded.  This is obviously terrible. Need to think a bit more about input flags.  Currently using single_restart_in to test what kind of io you should do, not sure if this is the correct thing to do. Updated obs_def_1d_state_mod.f90, only tested with raw_state_variable. This probably needs a closer look when you test lorenz_96 more thoroughly. No inflation or diagnostics.

    Up to date lorenz_96 now using the distributed_state module. Can now use a single restart file ( I think any kind ) with aread(write)_state_restart called from read_tranpose / tranpose_write.   This version does not work because of %vloc stuff in assim_tools_mod, you need to comment these out if for some reason you want to run this version.  There is some temporary lorenz_96 stuff that needs fixing in state_vector_io_mod.f90

    Part way through changing the reading/writing of inflation files to use the state vector io module. The read/write loop queries the copy number to see if it should  write it. On no account should you use this version. Note that this also has Nancy's change to mpi_utilities_mod to not make a temporary array before sending. Side note: should the state vector io read multiple domains at once? How do you want to get the model size?

    Several bug fixes, for limited memory with limited processors, the last commit of state_vector_io_mod.f90 was junk.  Tested with odd sized last groups and with 4096 processors on Yellowstone.  No memory errors this time.  There are still lots of commented about print statements, these will be removed later.  Hard coded mpi_real8, this needs changing to check what the datasize is (r4 or r8).  Also need a namelist option for limit_procs, limit_mem. These are hard coded in filter at the moment.  What about the read of inflation?  How does this work?

    Input file now works for multiple groups.  This is totally wrf specific (actually Helen specific) at the moment.  You need to have the wrfinput files named wrfinput_d0*.3 . This obviously needs to be changed to however wrf names their files. Not tested as part of filter with multiple domains yet.  Bitwise (my machine) with Lanai if you switch the lanai_bitwise flag = .true. in assim_tools.

    Bug fixes. 1. Should only be setting the vertical location in assim_tools if you have lanai_bitwise set to false.  Removed call to error_handle for when doing vertical conversion in get close.  This is perfectly allowable if you want to be bitwise with Lanai. 2. Should not transpose after reading the restart files if you are reading directly form restart files.

    Pulled vertical conversion of observations outside the sequential_obs do loop. Test code at the moment, it will only work for wrf as it relies on calling vert_convert_distrib.  Also the location type is public, this will need to be made private again ( filter_assim calling accessor functions).

    Number of copies in the MPI window and the mean row now in data_structure_mod so it is stored in one place and other modules can access this information.  The idea is to not have state_ens_handle%num_copies -5 hard coded all overt the code.  Note I have only checked this with WRF at the moment.

    Isolated pnetcdf calls so you can compile without needing to have pnetcdf. Use path_names_filter_no_pnetcdf if you want to compile without pnetcdf, path_names_filter_pnetcdf if you want to use pnetcdf.  The default (path_names_filter) is no pnetcdf. If your namelist option is to write in parallel, but you haven't compiled with pnetcdf the code over rides your namelist option.  Not sure whether this is more or less annoying than erroring out.

    Separated window creation and free into its own module.  This allows you to make a window using cray pointers, or not using cray pointers. Fwd_op_win_mod.f90 has become distributed_state_mod.f90. Hopefully this is a more descriptive name. I still have a window for the all copies of the state, and one for just the mean state. This allows you to treat them separately, but is that an advantage?  It may be simpler (& fewer synchronizations) to just have the whole copies window open throughout the algorithm.

    Version of the window module that does not use cray pointers.  I'm not sure whether there will be a performance penalty by not using MPI_ALLOC_MEM to create the memory for the window.  Also, I am not sure if it is best to attach the window to a contiguous piece of memory.

    Distributed phb.  Bitwise my machine with Lanai using height or pressure for the vertical localization. There is no local phb in this code.  So nc_write_model_atts doesn't write phb - you don't have phb in the diag files. Group size still hard coded to 4.  Need to close the window.

    First hack through distributed phb in model_mod. Only for get_state_meta_data and only for localization in height.  Group size hard coded as 4. Need to free the window.  Still have pub in the wrf static data structure so I can compile the code.  Filename for pub needs to go somewhere.  Need to think about how you could switch this ( distributing phb ) on and off.

    Tidied up the complete state name list options. No longer is there a complete_state option in filter.  There is a function in ensemble manager filter can use to check if the complete state can be used for reading and writing restart files and diagnostic files. I think ensemble manager is the place for this namelist option because ensemble manager needs to know whether or not to allocate %vars when it sets up the ensemble.  Still need to separate diagnostic writing options.

    Default name list option for complete state contradicted the default no complete state in ensemble manager causing a crash if you used the default options.  Default is to allow complete state for reading and writing (diagnostics and restarts). This should really just be one option in ensemble manager.

    IO: Three options:
    1. Regular: read in binary restarts (vars) and transpose to copies.
    2. Read in ens_size*netcdf restarts into copies.
    3. Read in one giant restart (netcdf) into copies.
    
    2. is really slow. 3. is an improvement on 2. but has a long way to go (its just a hack).  Tough to beat 1. especially if you layout the ensemble one copy per node (~26GB to go at before you have to worry about a parallel read).
    
    complete_state =.true. - will use the complete state for IO (restart and diagnostics).  The algorithm is distributed with one execption:
    task 0 still writes the obs_sequence file, so there is a transpose (copies to vars) and sending the obs_ens_handle%vars to task 0. Keys is also size obs%vars.
    Binary restarts, regular netcdf diagnostic files
    
    if you set complete_state = .false. then you either read in ens_size restart files (netcdf)
     or one giant.nc restart file containing all the ensemble members. Also dumps out the diagnostic
     files as a complete state vector - do you want to output this as a column or a row?
     The giant restart files are annoying.  I think reading them with a transpose
     (see ensemble manager) is slow, but making them already transposed is really slow.
    
     Note that you need to match the complete_state option in filter.nml with the
     no_complete_state_option in ensemble_manager.nml. This is really clunky.

    Added giant restart files.  Aim is to read from one giant file rather than 80 small ones.  The problem is making the restart file quickly makes the filter read slow and vise versa. Committing this now before I change it around to get a compromise.

    Changed the pnetcdf calls to check the datasize (MPI_REAL4, MPI_REAL8) DART-14 (Jira) then write double or single precision accordingly.  Not I have only tested this with WRF.  (Need to make some CAM netcdf restart files - next job).   Also, outputting the inflation is incorrect in the diagnostic files.  I am just outputting missing r8 when there is no inflation.

    Changed location to be intent(in) rather than intent(inout) in the forward operator.  This was a relic of trying to save the converted vertical location of the observation so it does not have to be recalculated in filter_assim (this should be done. needs some thought on how to do it). For now I have just removed this junk to minimize set-get_location problems. Note the pnetcdf calls are still single precision, so you have to compile with r4 = r8.

    Timing for reading ens_size restart files with pnetcdf.  Spoiler: it is hideously slow.  Can we make one giant restart file?  Also timing for diagnostic writes with pnetcdf.  This is more promising.  At the moment, the namelist option writes both parallel or neither parallel ( both means restart and diag files ).  I think these need to be separate options.

    If statements so you can read and write state complete.  At the moment, it does all (restarts and diagnostics) or nothing.  Probably will want separate options for restart and diagnostic writes.  This needs testing on Yellowstone, both for bitwise and memory usage.  Still have to allocate a vars array for the observations to do obs_space_diagnostics. This is because task 0 updates the obs_sequence.  To change this requires some thought as the seq structure is not as simple as the state copies array (you can't just dump it with a strided write).

    First go at parallel write of diagnostic files.  Just for WRF still (using netcdf real variables - single precision). Uses the same clunky name list option in filter to write in parallel or have task 0 do all the writing. You have to have large file support turned on in netcdf ( this a name list option in filter ).  I am creating the files with netcdf and loading them up using init_diag_output ( still not sure why we write info in both files at runtime, prior and posterior )  then writing to them with parallel netcdf. Parallel netcdf supports large files anyway ( seems to perform better the larger files you give it). The files are just a dump of the state copies array for speed.  Use this and the meta data to convert to regular diagnostic files (prognostic, I believe we call them).  Currently dumping too many copies in the posterior diag file, because I am dumping start_copy to end_copy rows in the copies array. So the meta data is wrong for the copies too.  I don't really want to shuffle data around before writing it, so a simple fix for this would be to have the mean copies in the middle and the prior and posterior inflation copies on either side. Just a thought.

    Reading simple netcdf restarts in parallel using pnetcdf or just doing a regular read of binary restarts. Bitwise reading either way on yellowstone and my machine. Note this is hard coded for single precision because I was testing with wrf.  Will have to do something clever to switch between real and double pnetcdf calls - don't want the model worrying about this. If you read in parallel, every processor gets the time. Clunky name list options at the moment, need to set 'complete state' in filter and 'no_complete_state' in ensemble_manager. Added a pnetcdf utilities module, it only has the error check subroutine in at the moment.

    Stripped out vertical conversion by owner of the observation. This could go back in later, but it would probably make more sense to do it like wrf does the state vertical conversion in get state meta data. If you do the vertical conversion as part of the SEQUENTIAL_OBS: do loop you are increasing the sequential part of the algorithm. Note, no one has the mean copy in the distributed version, so you have to communicate to do any vertical conversion.

    Added comments to filter and assim_model_mod. filter.separate_seq.f90 is filter.f90 but each task updates its own sequence in obs_space_diagnostics, included here just for future reference. The sequences would need to be merged together for output. Not sure why every task has a full sequence (all copies) allocated, since only task 0 ever fills the seq.

    Added some junk to assim_tools_mod, in order to make WRF run bitwise reproducible on my machine. I think this is due to the number of get and set_location calls.  Waiting for a test on Yellowstone to see if setting PI, DEG2RAD, and RAD2DEG fixes this problem so I can remove the junk.  Also added 'test functions' which really just dump out arrays to file.  Use these only with one observation, otherwise you will have gigantic files being written.  Removed remote memory access variables from get_obs_ens_distrib_state (they are no longer used here). Bunch of changes in wrf model_mod: Interfaces for functions/subroutines that are used by the forward op (ensemble) and by the localization (mean). Removed 'win' and 'ens_size' from subroutine and function arguments.

    Windows for one sided communication now in their own module, fwd_op_win_mod. Overloaded get_state so it either grabs an array (forward operator) or a single value (vertical conversion). Removed win from the arguments to the forward operator and vertical conversion. - all through the call tree. Not that this is only working for CAM_FV at the moment. Bitwise reproducible with the trunk on gfortran on my machine. WRF and CAM_SE still to do. Moved get state from data_structure_mod to fwd_op_win_mod.

    Adding directory to store mpi window modules.  The aim is to hide the
    mpi windows from the rest of the code.

    Tidier version of storing the converted vertical coordinate - taken from CAM_SE code. Removed redundant obs_loc_distirb, this is a relic from testing overwriting the vertical coordinate. Had to set the lat lon values for 'new_array' in convert_vert, these were being set to MISSING_R8 ( they were not being used ).  Stripped out non-distributed code. Model_heights_distrib needs checking, see comment about 'phi needs to be ensemble size'

    cam_se model_mod for distributed state vector. No distributed grid info. Bitwise with cam_se branch, with the caveat that failed forward operators get interp_val = MISSING_R8 in the cam_se branch. There are a lot of holes in this code, it is the bare minimum to compare bitwise with the cam_se branch.

    Now using compute_copy_mean_var.  Still need to decide whether you want to do the forward op on the mean state or calculate the mean after. Added lines to destroy var complete and reform it after the forward operator, just to make sure there are no cheats.

    Locations for get_close_obs. STATE: Distributed version of get state meta data. Converting state location on the fly is very slow, so now doing the conversion in state meta data. OBSERVATIONS: Model interpolate is set up to output the location, see line 1213. This location is not related to the my_obs_loc in filter_assim yet.

    Have the owner of an observation convert the z coordinate to the required localization coordinate. This is a fudge at the moment so it assumes height in filter_assim. The vertical conversion code needs smartening up, it only needs to do calculations using the mean.

    WRF commit. Same obs_def_mod.f90 caveat, eventually the obs_def should be generated by preprocess. Removed non-distributed versions of routines. This is more for testing than anything else. I do not want accidental calls to these routines. Replaced dart_ind array with a function new_dart_ind. It needs improving to work with multiple domains.  The vert_convert routine is very slow (too slow). The problem to overcome is that in the Trunk version of the code, the mean copy is on every processor thus the vertical conversion is done for every piece of state in get_state_meta_data. This is much harder (i.e. communication) for the distributed state.

    Made the internals of location_type_distrib private, so added functions to get/set the variables.  Added a location_type_distirb for observations - this needs testing with some observations that are not in pressure. Temp_ens is filter_state_space_diagnostics is now a deferred array (:) rather than model_size so only task 0 has an ensemble size array.

    Removed the copy sized array from all tasks except task 0.  It is used to write store copies from other tasks on task 0 when task 0 writes the diagnostic files in filter_state_space_diagnostics. This required changing get_copy in ensemble manager to only check that the receiving task has enough space. Corrected a bug in the diagnostic code that I folded into get_obs_ens_distrib_state: now correctly initializing good_forward_op = .true..

Author: kershaw-dart <Helen>

    First hack through distributed version of filter_assim.  The distributed part is calculating the height in get_close_obs_distrib without having access to a var complete ensemble copy. This is really clunky at the moment. I still have the 'results' array in there. I am remaking the mpi window.  The cam case I am using to develop the code does all the vertical localization in pressure. Pressure is all I have been working with. I am cheating at the moment with public access to the type 'location_type_distrib'. This is a duplicate of location_type but with a second vertical coordinate (the localization coordinate).  I have this so I can store the vertical location in pressure of each piece of state vector.  The trunk recalculates this for every observation (global). For my cam case this is ~200 000 times. This is extremely slow (10 minutes vs a couple of seconds for the trunk version) in the distributed case if you don't store the vertical location because you have to do communication for each calculation. Now, testing my case on Yellowstone, the distributed version is faster than the trunk for 512 and 128 procs. This may change if you ramp up the optimization, but it definitely means the repetition of the vertical conversion in the Trunk has a high cost. I am unsure if the distributed assimilation will scale because you are increasing communication as you increase the number of processors, however, you may get some gains if you have spatially local state on the same processor.

    Removed the ps_distrib array.  Building this was taking far too much time (~300 seconds). No need to build it for the distributed case, you can just grab the surface pressure you need for each observation.  Quick test on Yellowstone, distributed is 0.4s versus 1s for regular, 1024 procs, 282026 obs. Initialized results array to missing_r8 in filter.

    First commit of CAM distributed forward operator. Note, this is the same as the Lorenz96 and WRF code where you need to run preprocess then delete obs_def_mod.f90 and update it from the repository. This is a temporary measure to avoid changing preprocess for now. This code is correct (as far as I have tested it), but it is very slow. The time is spent in mpi_win_unlock in the subroutine set_ps_arrays_distrib.  I don't think there is any need to build this array, you should just grab the surface pressure when you need it for a given lon, lat.  I am committing this version now before I pull out set_ps_arrays_distrib.

    WRF version of RMA. Bug fix for unique k loop.  I had changed the loop to only do communication once for each unique level, rather than the for each ensemble, but I was not using the correct value of k. Also corrected the missing value check to only look at the ensemble members.

    Changed communication loop in the horizontal interpolation to loop only around the required levels (k) rather than around the ensemble. The distributed code was not exactly replicating the behavior of the original code because the distributed code exited early if one of the copies failed the vertical interpolation. Thus, expected_obs(:) = missing_r8. Removed the bail out if the vertical interpolation returns missing_r8, just keep track of the ensemble copies that this occurs on.  Continue with the forward operator, then put the missing_r8 back into expected ons. Tested on my machine, the code reproduces the correct forward operator results.

    Tidied up the mpi_gets into a subroutine call. The 'wrong element' in the previous commit is caused by the distributed subroutine bailing out for all ensembles if vertical coordinate is missing ( Line 3511 ). In the non distributed version the ensemble copies are unaware that one of the other copies could have failed so they complete their forward operators. Some discussion needed as to whether the forward operator is needed if one of the ensembles fails.

    First go at distributed forward operator for WRF specific humidity.  Changes in filter are just for timing. Obs_def_mod.f90 is committed to the repository because I have not changed preprocess.  Note to use the lorenz model you will need to check out the previous version of obs_def_mod.f90.  The communication for the interpolation is dumb at the moment. It loops around the ensembles, because k ( the pressure level ) of the observation could be different across ensembles.  Most likely it will not be ens_size different ks, so you could reduce this communication easily(!).  Note you need the bitwise flag with compilation, otherwise there are many bit-ish errors.  The code is not quite correct, getting an incorrect element of %copies on yellowstone. Note that to get rid of ens_size storage we need a function to get from the state vector to wrf ( it is a huge array on each processor at the moment) .

    Moved mpi_win_create after the duplicate arrays is filled.  This was creating a problem because the window was being written to during an exposure epoch.  The debugging info is still in the code. Added ensemble/data_structures_mod.f90 to path_names_filter.

    First crack at distributed forward operator for regular obs.  All this does is fill up an array that should be a duplicate of obs_ens_handle%copies. It is for lorenz_96.  I've added obs_seq_mod.f90 as a shortcut, rather than altering preprocess. I created data_structure_mod.f90 which has the ensemble type and routines needed by model_mod.f90 (Lorenz_96) to do a distributed forward operator.  Some discussion needed on whether this is ok from a software engineering point of view. The reason for creating data_structure_mod.f90: ensemble_manager_mod uses assim_model_mod uses model_mod.  model_mod cannot use ensemble_manager_mod because it would be a circular dependency.   Not looked at RAW_STATE_1D_INTEGRAL. Minimal initial testing: works on my machine for obs_seq.out, two processors.  Note this is 'rough draft' of code.

    Single precision was not enough in the calculation of the element index. This lead to the incorrect column being grabbed in MPI get.  Fix is to use double precision for the division. Added a repeat of get_obs_ens_distrib_state.  Still seeing a significant difference between the first communication and the second.

    Prevented get_obs_ens_distrib_state from modifying any obs_ens_handle%vars.  I think this was causing seg faults in filter assim (tricky because it only happened at some task counts - be aware in case this is not fixed - test lots of task counts).  Set a dummy value for obs_vals, since obs_vals(i) = state(-1 * obs_kind_ind) assumes that each task has the whole state vector.  Need to check the consequences of this.

    The 'wrong column' problem was caused by using a local variable number as a global variable number. Added a function to ensemble manager to calculate the global number from the local variable number.  I have only tested this for tiny cases on my machine.  There are lots of junk print statements that will need to be removed. There are also several places in get_obs_ens where local (j) is used instead of the global number.

    First hack through a distributed forward operator for identity obs only.  Initial test on my machine ( 2 processors) : the first column of results matches obs_ens_handle%copies, the second does not.  Committing so I can test this on Yellowstone which has a more ruthless mpi implementation.  The auxiliary copies need to be dealt with (currently ignoring them until I have the remote memory access correct).  This code follows Jeff's plan of creating a get_expected_obs_distrib_state and get_obs_ens_distrib_state and to verify these results against get_expected_obs, get_obs_ens ( i.e. obs_ens_handle%copies ).  I have put two functions in the ensemble manager to return which pe has a given element of a state vector, and what column the element is in when copy complete. I don't think this functionality was in there, but I may be missing something.

    the input.nmls in the cases dir, we will need to have that file

    default namelists, it isn't an error if the right size file isn't
    found, but there's a warning printed out with help for making one
    if you need it.  we are assuming that most reasonable ensemble
    sizes will have a file already created for that size.

    fixed 4 places where the 'has copies or vars been most
    recently updated' flag was not set right.  this resulted
    in skipping a needed transpose before writing out the
    prior diagnostics if not using inflation.  this has been
    broken on the trunk since 12jun2013 when the development
    branch was reintegrated.
    
    in looking over the code i also fixed an error test that
    was backwards, and i added some white space around some
    subroutine calls to make the code easier to read.

    in the xxx_assimilate.csh scripts remove the last
    reference to the DART directory.  the setup scripts
    will now copy the sampling error correction file into
    the CASEROOT dir so these scripts can pick it up from
    there if it is needed.
    
    remove the deprecated CESM1_1_1_setup.csh script;
    rename the other scripts so there is a 'initial' script
    which has code to pick up the starting files from
    various other places.  the 'continuation' script
    assumes there's an existing experiment where the
    contents of the 'rest' directory contains everything
    you need to begin.
    
    moved code to copy over the final_full.xx file if
    needed for the sampling error correction into the
    setup scripts.  tried to make the two scripts as
    similiar as possible.
    
    added code to the end of the short term archive
    script, partially based on alicia's changes.
    it does two things - one is that it only leaves
    3 restart directories a month in the archive
    dir for long term archiving.  if you have to
    go back and restart, it will be from the 1st,
    the 10th, or the 20th.  if you want to save
    more steps, edit the end of the st_archive.sh
    and change the test for the day numbers.
    
    one thing that the archive script will do now
    is it will also keep the restart files from the
    very last successful step until the next step
    has succeeded - both model advance and assimilation.
    
    so if a step fails the last step can be restarted.
    these restart files are not visible to the long term
    archiver, so they won't be archived.  they are stored
    in the archive directory in a subdir called .sta2
    which is hidden unless you use 'ls -al' to see it.
    (this is the same strategy the short term archiver
    uses to protect partially archived dirs from being
    picked up by the long term archiver.)
    
    the 'reset_last_successful_step' script should now
    try to find the .sta2 files first before looking
    in the 'rest' directory.

    Moved the 'cd to tempdir' to after the time determination
    which allows us to use the same relative filename for the
    pointer file to use to determine the time. (in both the
    CESM-flavor and individual model scripts)
    
    Enabled the use of a cookie file for CAM startup to flag
    the first model advance and possible creation of initial
    inflation files so you don't have to have initial inflation
    files before you startup - and can continue to have the
    input.nml 'inf_initial_from_restart' TRUE for the entire
    experiment.
    
    Set the configured ensemble size in the namelists that
    are staged in the CASEROOT directory and removed it from
    the assimilate.csh scripts. Less mysterious.

    rename the MODIS directory to 'tpw' since this converter
    starts with ASCII input files instead of reading the HDF-EOS
    MODIS files.  rework the code to have more namelist values.
    update the superobs code to wrap correctly around the
    prime meridian, and average the values in time as well
    (instead of using the time of the first obs being
    averaged).  write documentation and leave a pointer
    to a single data file which can be used for testing.
    
    updated the docs for several of the other observation
    converters. the snow doc was basically a copy of the
    text_to_obs docs without any changes.  the quikscat
    docs had the sense of the thinning backwards (the code
    is fine; the description was misleading).  the AIRS
    docs didn't include a namelist section at all.
    
    also starting to convert the namelists into
    the &bob a=1 b=2 format instead of namelist /bob/ a, b

    All of these files are pretty much straight text files (there are a few exceptions).
    The straight text files are supposed to have the following svn properties:
    
      svn:mime-type
        text/plain
      svn:keywords
        Date Rev Author HeadURL Id
      svn:eol-style
        native
    
    The _nc files are netCDF files, so they get a mime-type of application/x-netcdf
    
    My scripts key on the file extension. If the extension is misleading or nonexistent,
    it causes problems. BUT - I am pretty sure these are right.

    same fix as on the development branch:
    set the TLON and TLAT arrays to an initial value of 0 before
    doing anything else.  the subsequent code uses a where() clause
    before one set of columns in those arrays have been given a value.
    the previous code did not generate any wrong values, but testing
    uninitialized memory could cause FPEs depending on what happened
    to be at those memory locations.

    fix a bug in the termination code - if the end time was exactly
    one window before 0Z, it would fail the end test and loop forever.
    
    also add an option (off by default for backwards compatibility)
    to allow the script to loop over missing input files.  if some
    time periods are missing some types of input files there is now
    an option to complain on standard output but continue to run.
    
    also added a couple tests to be sure the required executables
    exist and point to where they are built if they aren't found.
    
    finally, remove some commented out lines that gave alternatives
    for how to name the files and directories, and other windows.
    they looked pretty specific and users can change the location
    of the input and output files as they'd like.

    fix error in moisture obs locations - they are not located on the levels.
    instead, they are actually the mean of the layers between the fixed levels.
    (levels, layers are the AIRS terminology for these things.)
    
    temperature obs were ok before - located on the levels - but moisture obs
    have changed location in this version of the converter - they are now located
    at the midpoint, in log space, between the levels.
    
    other housekeeping: changed mss commands in the scripts to use the hsi interface;

    to describe the location issues with the moisture obs.

    the start and end times get ignored if the run values are set,
    and the scripts use start and end to control the cycling.

    get_state_meta_data() was returning level numbers between 2-6 for the temperature field if no tracers are defined. the interpolation and results are (and have always been) correct; just the level numbers reported by get_state_meta_data() are incorrect.  this fix makes it return levels 1-5 for temperature, regardless of the number of tracers defined.

    commit a minor change that's been on the development branch for a long time.
    do not try to put an ensemble-sized array on the stack when reading/writing
    a restart file; make it allocatable so it comes from the heap.  this helps
    prevent stack-overflow problems.   also added a small utility routine to set
    the time associated with an ensemble member; matches the existing get routine.

    The models with potentially large state vectors should have the netCDF_large_file_support enabled
    by default. Support for large netCDF files is much more common than it used to be.
    The downside to this is if someone was to try to use netCDF libraries/modules that were built
    with large file support turned off. I consider this to be really unlikely.

    reset return code from vertical convert in the get_close_obs()

    Reset the focus on the oned_ensemble.m script … crosshairs now visible.
    The crosshairs in the twod_ensemble.m worked, so I just compared the differences
    between the two files and took a lucky stab at it. I don't understand the code,
    but the crosshairs work in both files. There is no functional change in the

    Significant winds come in with vertical units of height in meters.
    Use a variable with the name height instead of reusing the pressure
    array.  Also, the conversion routine from height to pressure, in
    order to get the correct obs error, only works up to 44km and then
    gives a segfault.  Limit the largest height going into the conversion

    Patch for the computation of correlation for inflation/sampling error
    when running with R4 precision.  With very small values it was possible
    for both A and B to test larger than 0, but A*B was small enough to
    underflow and be 0.  The original code was doing the tests separately
    and not testing the product before dividing by it. With very small vals
    it was possible to divide by 0 and get NaN or Inf (depending on the numerator).
    Inf would get reset to 1.0 in the lines below but NaN would remain as
    NaN and percolate through the code to the output state vector unless you
    were running with floating point exceptions enabled (which usually carries
    a performance penalty).
    
    This revised code checks the values in a slightly different order to
    avoid computation if we are going to be setting the correlation to 0
    anyway, and it is more careful to check for 0s in the face of underflow
    with R4 precision.  There is still a risk of overflow in this code with
    very large data values; we do not recommend running with reals compiled
    R4 if your data includes values with very large (eg 1e15+) values.

    If the user has selected vertical localization but both the vertical
    units are VERTISSURFACE, do only a horizontal distance computation
    because there is no normalization factor for surfaces.  without this
    extra line of code the computation was using -1 as an index into
    the normalization factors and picking up who knows what as a value.

    For localization in SCALEHEIGHT units the surface pressure is required.
    Compute it correctly for the staggered U and V fields.  The original code
    was computing it on the mass points and was referencing outside an array
    for the last row and column of those fields.

    same change as on kodiak branch:
    The code to timestamp the 'processing N of M obs' was there
    but commented out.  a while ago i added a way for this module
    to know if the output_timestamps namelist variable from the
    filter namelist was on or off but never put in the logic
    to have it control timestamping each print msg.  this
    minor change fixes it so it does.

Author: Tomoko Matsuo <Tomoko>

    "model_interpolate" now uses the gravity-adjusted geopotential height computed by TIEGCM for vertical interpolation.
    In order to pass the geopotential height specific to each ensemble member to the "model_interpolate" routine, the
    DART state vector includes the gravity-adjusted 3D geoponetial height fields as auxiliary variables.
    Note that the updated geopotential height fields are not passed back to TIEGCM.
    
    "get_state_meta_data" uses the ensemble mean of the gravity-adjusted geopotential height to assign height
    information to each element of the DART state vector.  TIEGCM's natural vertical coordinate is pressure.
    For the sake of vertical localization that requires the computation of distance between obs and states,
    it is easier to use height as vertical coordinates for now.
    
    The order in which 3D TIEGCM fields are placed in the DART state vector is changed to accommodate
    the usage of the module for assimilation of neutral density observations only (Use "only_neutral_density" switch).
    
    Set "estimate_parameter" to be true to update model 1D parameters, when 1D paramters are included as part of
    the DART state vector (i.e., state_num_1d > 0). Otherwise model 1D parameters will not be estimated.

    for the non-local operator.  This code was mistakenly using
    only the requested output observation heights as the profile.

    Fix an error in the interpolation code if the profile crosses crosses the
    dateline (-180/180 longitude) and the user has requested an observation at
    a height exactly between the two levels where the longitude changes sign.
    (in the input file the longitude is between -180 and 180.  we convert it to
    be between 0 and 360 after computing the interpolated longitude.) while this
    is an actual bug, from the amount of work it was to find a test case to
    reproduce it i'm going to say that it had very little impact on the
    observation files we have already generated.
    Also make the test for a requested observation at the lowest level in the
    file have an epsilon when testing for equality.  Otherwise in some cases
    an observation at the lowest level is mistakenly deemed to be below the
    lowest data level and a fatal error is thrown.
    Thanks to xingqin for pointing these two things out.

    Various fixes for html files, including:
    - No spaces in link names (e.g. <A NAME="NO GOOD">)
    - all & changed to &amp;
    - misspelled table attribute 'celpadding' -> 'cellpadding'
    - list items with tables or embedded lists need to have
      the tags be:  <LI>stuff
                       <table> or another <list>
                    </LI>
        and not:    <LI>stuff</LI>
                      other stuff outside any <LI> sections
    - not sure if this is because of the standard or not, but
      the validators don't like tables or lists inside paragraph
      tags.  so close the pending paragraph before other tags.

    Change all the relative html page links to absolute pathnames
    pointing at our SVN server.  I had to pick a path and right now
    these use the trunk since we don't have the Kodiak branch
    created yet.  When we branch, we should probably change 'trunk'
    in these hrefs to 'branches/Kodiak' or 'tags/Kodiak', depending
    on what we do.
    
    This is to make the release notes work for both a local checkout
    of the tree, and for our webserver-hosted pages where everything
    in DART/doc/html is actually copied to the equivalent of the DART
    level, and relative hrefs won't work.

    to be used by the matlab scripts, so it exists before running them.

commit 46139f734c54c1ff6204cb497b1b55bb70e471f0
Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Wed Jun 8 08:55:02 2011 -0600

    Changes in how we set the mean and stddev when there are failed
    forward operators.  The older code set the values right before
    they were written out.  This code sets the values inside the obs
    loop right when they're computed, and in addition has a section
    to set the posterior values if any of the posterior forward operators
    failed, even if the prior qc is bad (the particular case where this
    is possible is when the prior fails the outlier threshold test, but
    all the prior forward operators worked).   Also make the same changes
    to the radar folded version of filter to keep it in sync.
    
    Change the names of OBS_PRIOR_MEAN_... and OBS_PRIOR_VAR_...
    to just OBS_MEAN_... and OBS_VAR_... because they are used both
    when computing the prior and posterior values.  these are internal
    to the filter_main() subroutine and so are not visible outside the
    subroutines in which they are used.  just for a bit more clarity.
    (there's already a separate flag passed down to the obs diag routine
    to say whether we're computing the prior or posterior.)

    and advance_time.
    - Minor changes to CAM model_mod, including adding a routine to
    write out the times file so utilities can call it in a single
    location, plus additional optional arg on write routine.
    - Most debugging output is off by default; a new namelist
    item 'print_details' will re-enable the original output.
    - Added build support for new tools (closest member, common
    subset, fill inflation) and removed for obsolete (merge obs).
    - The original 'trans' build files and src are now in a
    'deprecated' directory so if users need them for backwards
    compatibility, they are still available.
    - The archive scripts are updated for the HPSS (hsi) and
    the MSS versions (msrcp) are removed.
    - The shell_scripts and full_experiment scripts are updated.

    versions of CAM.  Minor updates to model_mod to add optional
    args to the read/write routines, and move the write_times
    routine into the model mod so internal arrays won't have to
    be public.

    In the observation diagnostic routine, before it writes out the obs_seq.final
    file, the code now checks for observations where the DART QC is 4, 5, or 6.
    In these cases the forward operator failed, the observation was not processed
    because of namelist control, or the incoming data qc was bad.  In these cases
    the corresponding prior/posterior mean and sd are set to MISSING_r8 before
    writing the values to the obs_seq.final file.  This allows post-processing
    programs to recognize these as bad values without additional code to check
    the dart qc.

    Fix for the long-standing '3d box bug'.  At any latitude except the equator
    the furthest longitude that is 'maxdist' away by a great circle calculation
    does not happen at the same latitude, so you can't just add and subtract
    maxdist to find out the min and max longitude that is still within maxdist
    of a point.  This is why all the computations here (except for where this
    bug arises) are done in radians.  The one place where the computations were
    adding distances along latitude lines was where the code was trying
    to see if all the locations for this particular task are clustered and so
    the boxes can be restricted to a subregion of the sphere.  The code now
    uses great circle distances and computes the latitude at which the longitude
    is the furthest away.   The code also bypasses some of the computations
    if it's clear that the boxes will have to cover the entire range of longitudes.
    
    Update to the documentation to include a section on the geometry for
    this computation, just because it's fun.
    
    Also minor changes to the formatting of the debug code, and a fix for
    COMPARE_TO_CORRECT. If the optional distance argument is not supplied
    this routine returns all locations in nearby boxes, which is a superset of
    the actual number of locations within maxdist.  It was doing an exact
    compare in all cases, which is too restrictive.

    Extended obs_diag to finalize the netCDF file even when using
    obs_seq.out files as input (the tables relating observation types
    and integers is useful in decoding the locations file, if requested).
    The output is restricted to only put the observation types USED as
    netcdf global attributes.
    
    The wind_obs_* stuff is completely superceded by the obs_seq_to_netcdf
    and this version of plot_wind_vectors.

    New tool to select out the obs from a pair of obs_seq.final files which have
    good QCs for both the prior & posterior in both files.  Assumes that the same
    obs_seq.out was used as input to filter in both experiments.  This allows the
    observation diagnostic differences to be more easily attributed to
    differences in the experimental setup and not confounded with differences in
    the number of obs assimilated.

    Update the default linux line to a combination that works
    with the intel compiler.  This script should probably be
    reworked to select a compiler (pgi, ifort, etc) instead of
    a platform (sun, ibm, linux, etc).

    Wrap an error message to keep length of each line < 72 chars, so
    we don't have to specify any particular compiler flags to parse
    longer lines.

    Several critical fixes for those users who redefine R8 to be R4.
    
    1. Compute variance and covariance in more numerically stable ways
    if running with single precision reals.  The previous code was fine
    when running with real*8, but the updated code retains more accuracy
    when running real*4.  Could have had a noticeable impact on results.
    
    2. Fix minor issues with the Sampling Error Correction; a few of
    the constants were incorrect and there was the possibility of an
    out-of-range array index being computed.  In general the effects
    were minor.
    
    3. Several numerical constants were explicitly marked _r8 to set
    the kind.
    
    4. Added an informational message to the dart log if running
    with the sampling error correction enabled.

    New program that converts a cam initial file (caminput.nc) to

    as opposed to some external source.  The input and output
    filenames for cam_to_dart.f90 are namelist controlled, so there
    is a new namelist (cam_to_dart_nml) in input.nml.  There is still
    a model_mod:static_init_model() dependency on cam_phis.nc,
    the name of which is now part of the model_nml namelist.

    In 3 places this code converted integer nx,ny into reals
    using the dble() intrinsic in order to pass a real value to
    a subroutine as an argument.  However if this code is compiled
    with r8 redefined to be r4 it screws up the subroutine call
    because the caller is passing 8 bytes and the receiving code
    is expecting 4 bytes. Garbage ensues. This is a problem because
     wrf/dart is frequently compiled r4.
    
    This fixed version explicitly declares real(r8) vars
    and does an assignment so the conversion happens correctly.
    The symptom of the bad code was that observations interior
    to the domain incorrectly had errors set to very large
    (possibly random) values.

    Utility to compute the 'distance' between a group of ensemble members and
    the ensemble mean.  The output prints the members in sorted order, and
    creates a small file which contains the name of the closest member.
    There are several choices for how the distance is computed, since different
    schemes might be more appropriate for different types of state vectors.
    
    To use this utility you must turn on the 'output_restart_mean' namelist
    option in the &filter_nml namelist, so that it will write the ensemble
    mean in restart file format when filter exits.

    along with setting a data value.  Could be used to set an incoming data QC in
    an obs_seq file that's missing one, for example.  Also added some more error
    checks to the copy_partial_obs() routine, and added initial values to the
    add_copies() and add_qc() routines (before, new copies or qcs had uninitialized
    values).  Updated the obs_sequence_tool docs to add examples of using the new

    This last part has not been heavily tested and so for now i've

    In all cases, the dummy code comes AFTER the fatal call
    to the error_handler(), so it will never get executed.
    There is no executable difference.

    Replacing the ancient CVS keywords with the closest SVN keywords.
    The runtime logging in 'logfile.out' will now be accurate.
    There is no dynamical change to the code - just better logging.

    Allow localization distances to be specified by-type.
    In the wrf model_mod, new option to localize in units of Scale Height,
    and compute vertical height as geometric and not geopotential meters.
    
    Details of the WRF model_mod changes include:
    - heights in meters are now computed as geometric height and not geopotential
      height.  to check backwards compatibility the original geopotential heights
      can be computed by setting 'use_geopotential_height' to true.
    - add scale_height option and conversions between other
      vertical units.  thanks to ryan torn for this code.
    - rename the 'vert_interpolate()' subroutine to 'vert_convert()'
      since it does no interpolation but does do conversion.
    - rewrite the vert_convert routine to use nested select
      statements instead of if/then/else's.  add comments, and
      return sooner in the routine if no conversion is needed.
    - change 'vert_coord' in the derived type to 'localization_coord'
      since that is more descriptive of what that variable is used for.
    - add a real perturbation routine but leave it commented out by default.
      see the comments in the code if you want to use it.
    
    if you have no observations using height in meters (e.g. the vertical coord
    is in pressure) and if you localize in pressure, this version should give
    identical results to the previous version.
    
    the changes to assim_tools and the location files are all for the
    'different localization distances by-type' option.  see the html file
    for details on how to use it.

    Fix two problems:
    1) initialize the uninitialized 'first_obs', and
    2) set the time_obs variable before it is used.
    Symptom was randomly the insert of a new obs would fail.
    No bad obs files were created as a result of this bug
    (time_obs was only used to optimize the insert, and
    not used when setting the actual observation time).
    Thanks to Russ Schumacher for pointing this out.

    After a model advance, when reading in the updated state vector
    explicitly check the timestamp of all state vectors, not just
    the first one in each task.  Would have caught a scripting error

    Reduce precision in fortran write statement from 16 to 14 significant
    digits.  Tested on gfortran and ifort on mac, xlf on ibm, and ifort on
    linux cluster. With 14 sig digits only a handful (< 30) of the 200 means
    and alphas differed across the platforms and compilers.  All differences
    were in the last digit and varied by no more than 1.
    Also moved the 2 subroutines into the program block following
    a 'contains' line.  that keeps us from having to set
    'implicit none' and add 'use' statements in each subroutine.

    Lifted from the coamps model files. a very simple example of
    a forward operator that queries the model for 2 different
    values and then computes the requested value.  thanks alex.

    Use /bin/sh instead of ksh; it runs fine with the original
    shell (tested on bluefire).  this should reduce our
    dependencies on how many different shells we need users
    to have.

    An updated version of the COAMPS model interfaces and scripts.
    Contributed by Alex Reinecke, NRL, Monterey.
    
    The primary differences from the original COAMPS model code are:
    
     - the ability to assimilate nested domains
     - assimilates real observations
     - a simplified way to specify the state vector
     - I/O COAMPS data files
     - extensive script updates to accommodate additional HPC environments

    revamped a while ago but never committed; i cleaned it up more with help
    from tim.  it should now be in shape to use as a good example of how to
    write an obs_def for observations with additional metadata. also updated
    the documentation to match.  the original version of this file wrote all
    the metadata for all 1d integral obs when it read or wrote the first obs
    of this type; i removed that code and now each obs writes its own metadata
    embedded in each observation.  if we do want to support global metadata
    we should make a new section and interface routine that is called only
    once per file when it's reading the header info.  or as tim suggests,
    just go to netcdf 4 for the obs_seq file format.  anyway - i could find
    no obs_seq files committed to the repository that used the old format
    so there should be no problems.  the tutorial uses this file but it
    goes through the interactive routine to generate obs_seq files on the
    fly and doesn't rely on any files in the repository.

    Setting the value of 'ivert' so the write() statement
    has something meaningful to write. The write() statement
    logs all the observations that are more than 3 standard deviations
    to a file called LargeInnov.txt This code block is a remnant
    from before the days of a useful DART error code and could easily
    be removed. It has no bearing on any of the diagnostics being

    Move the obs_utilities_mod.f90 file from 'MADIS' to the more generic 'utilities'
    directory since the utility routines are not specific to the MADIS converters
    and are being used more and more for other converters.   Update all related
    path_names files.
    
    New functionality in the prep_bufr converter from Ryan Torn.  can now optionally
    create relative humidity and/or dewpoint obs in addition to the already existing
    specific humidity obs.  requires a corresponding update to the ascii_to_obs
    converter (which now also uses the common routines in the obs_utilities_mod).

    Added option to print data min/max values for each field (U,V,Q,etc) as it is
    converted between WRF netcdf and DART state vector files.  The only functional
    change is that the date associated with the data after a model advance now
    comes directly from the time in the WRF output file and not just a copy of
    what DART asked the advance time to be (via the wrf.info file).  Before there
    was no way to catch a failed advance or non-updated output file based on the
    date inside the dart state vector file.
    
    There is one non-backwards-compatible change with this update - the dart_to_wrf
    utility now requires a namelist &dart_to_wrf_nml which is new.  The input.nml
    being committed here includes the new namelist.  It will need to be pasted into
    any input.nml files being used that aren't updated by the subversion updates.

    A shell script contributed by Josh Hacker which splits
    our daily NCEP obs_seq files into 4 6-hour files.  i added
    a few comments and pointed out where you'd need to change it
    for other uses.  but all in all it seems like a clean, simple
    base for scripting with obs_seq files so i'm adding it here.

    Added check to the set_[copy,qc]_meta_data() routine to
    ensure the string argument is left justified, trimmed, and no longer
    than the allocated string length of the target.
    
    Also fixed an allocation length error in add_qc() that
    was using the number of observation copies, not the number
    of qc copies ...
    
    Changed msg_string to msgstring to be more consistent.

    Using a types_mod parameter for the length of the metadata strings.
    At various places they were coded in different lengths - they are now
    a tidy 'types_mod:metadatalength' characters long. These strings are
    primarily used for the copy metadata ... 'posterior ensemble member 100'
    There's no need for these to be super long strings and causes them to
    be kinda ugly in a 'ncdump' output. BTW - 75 is the maximum length you
    can have for these strings and not cause ncdump to wrap it.
    The default value for types_mod:metadatalength is 64 right now.

    Made the NETCDF variable "mandatory".
    The NETCDF setting is commented out (in most cases) so that
    the user MUST have the right setting as an environment variable
    or MUST edit the template file.
    
    If the default was to have bounds checking ON, it
    is now OFF by default and an example of how to turn
    it on is shown as a comment at the end of the file.
    
    Most other changes are simply beautifying.

    Removed the transparency of the 'stripe' boxes that denote
    the definition of the vertical levels. After calling the
    'stripes' routine, the background axis and grid can be brought
    to the foreground by setting the axis 'Layer' property to 'top'.
    (this is what I tried to achieve by using transparency)
    
    This had several positive effects:
    
    1) using transparency required the use of the OpenGL renderer,
    which is buggy and caused the output to be rasterized. Even the .ps files.
    Fonts were not rendered as real fonts, it was just ugly.
    Because the 'painters' renderer can be used again, the file sizes are
    quite compact. Files went from 11395232 bytes to 27223 bytes! AND they resize
    better. Win-Win.
    
    2) the OpenGL renderer had a bug in it that cause spurious label elements
    to appear. For the dual-axis labels, I grab the ticks from the ones that are
    'nice' and determine the corresponding values for the other value and create
    and plot a character string to that effect. The OpenGL version had a bug
    in it that left the 'multiplier' floating about. For example, the number of
    observations is 10,000 for example. Matlab might plot it as 1.0 x 10^4.
    I grab it and actually plot it as 10000 - but the OpenGL renderer left the
    stupid x 10^4 string on the plot! Not good.
    
    I have yet to hunt down all the other places this strategy is used.

    The hemispheres are swapped (the dateline is repeated),
    the ticks and labels match the other figures in the paper,
    the aspect ratio is similar (if not identical) to the others figures,
    the fonts were increased. Finally, they are all preserved as EPS files,
    all as Peter requested. Save any highlighting box, these are done.

    A real forward operator for relative humidity.  The changes in the

    Changed all occurences of nnn_radial_vel to
    nnn_hf_radial_vel to avoid global symbol
    collisions with the (nexrad) radar obs_def file.
    This change should be invisible to everyone
    except users who have written their own high
    frequency radar (e.g. CODAR) obs converters.

    Added the output filenames as namelist variables for the obs_seq_coverage
    routines. Decided that both the textfile and netcdf files should be user-
    configurable, and that the general terminology should be that this thing
    creates a 'mask' of 'observation definitions'. Hence I'm calling these
    things obsdef_mask.[txt,nc] files. Changed the followon routines to
    use this same naming convention - i.e. changed obs_selection* to
    make it obvious.

    For now, have a namelist that says what type of file

    The observation sequence coverage program is now ready for friendly
    testing. The big change is that the output now reflects a temporal
    and spatial pattern. The program only selects the observation
    closest to the top of the hour since it was determined that some of
    the metar stations had multiple observations within a 10 minute window
    of the 'top of the hour'.  The namelist provides for the ability to
    only select 'stations' that have between 'X' and 'Y' temporal coverage
    (the site was observed at least 8 times, but not more than 40, for example)
    
    The www-page is forthcoming.

    Separate the access of the optional argument to a new line.
    It is legal for fortran compilers to evalute both parts of
    a compound if statement and in this case if 'restrict' is
    .false. 'use_list' isn't present and can cause core dumps.
    Not an error for any of the dart-supplied programs because

    Bug fix reported by Rahul Mahajan.  This bug affected
    update_wrf_bc when reading mass tendencies if there
    were more than a single time in the input file.
    The code was always reading the arrays for time 1.
    The distributed WRF scripts that we support were

    Change a large array on the stack to one that is only allocated
    on task 0 and only when it is actually going to be used.  This
    three line change fixed a core dump a pop/dart user at lanl was
    getting when filter was writing out the inflation restart file.

    As agreed in last week's wrf/dart meeting after looking at experiments
    done by so-young, the default dewpoint obs error has been dropped from
    0.10 to 0.05, and the minimum rh is now 0.20 instead of 0.10.

    Somehow this file had good values for state vector index 1, and garbage for
    index 2. So I ran the output from perfect_model_obs into filter (with
    start_from_restart set to .false.) and let filter run 1000 steps, and then
    took the filter_restart file and renamed it.  Hopefully that's an ok set of
    ic's for this model.  (it's got to be better than what was in the repos.)

    Major revision of the GPS scripts from Ryan Torn, with more tweaks by me.
    The scripts now download and convert a day at a time, 0Z to 0Z.  To construct
    files with obs from 03:01Z to 03:00 + 1 day, use the obs_sequence_tool.
    
    There is now a single wrapper script and all the download, convert, and
    cleanup is done by a second script.  The documentation has been updated
    to match the revised scripts.

    Made the "use outlier observations in the rank histogram" a namelist option.
    The default is to NOT use those observations in the rank histogram.
    You MUST specify 'outliers_in_histogram = .true.' if you want them.
    The netcdf file also contains the appropriate list of DART QC values that went
    into the rank_histogram, as well as a logical that reiterates the value of
    the namelist option.
    
    The 'horizontal_wind' "observations" can not get a rank histogram, so I put in logic
    to ensure they never get written to the netcdf file. The U,V components do, but the
    derived 'speed' does not. There is a log file message (an run-time) that specifies
    which variables have NO information in the rank histogram.

    Updates from Glen Romine.  Move all the different types of
    DEWPOINT obs definitions into the dew_point module, and remove
    them from the others.  In some cases they were incorrectly
    calling the direct interpolation routine instead of the
    forward operator code.  Also updated the two input.nml
    files which need the dew_point mod added to the preprocess list.
    
    If you get an error about DEWPOINT being missing or unknown,
    add obs_def_dew_point_mod.f90 to your preprocess namelist
    (&preprocess_nml in file input.nml) and rerun quickbuild.csh.

    Add the observation-space rank histogram routine.
    usage notes are included via the normal matlab 'help'
    mechanism.  The observation sequence file must be processed
    by obs_diag.f90 in the normal way. If there are ensemble members
    present in the obs_seq.final files, the rank histogram is automatically
    created. Simply use plot_rank_histogram.m to view the results ...
    
    The other changes at this time are to better determine
    the unique variable names. As a consequence, they are now
    also listed alphabetically (which was not the intent, but does no harm).

    If the namelist input does not intersect the information in the observation
    sequence files (most usually when the time information does not match) a nice
    little summary of the min/max timestamps in the observation file(s) and
    the namelist input is printed - providing guidance for better namelist input.
    The routine also errors out and does not create an output netcdf file.
    
    Beautiful ...

    Change all_vars_to_all_copies() so it has one task receiving
    round robin and all others sending concurrently.  This turns
    out to be significantly faster with large state vectors than
    the previous 'one rr sender, concurrent receivers'.  All the
    communications use synchronous send/recv calls.  Presumably
    the sends are executing concurrently and the data has been
    copied to local memory already so the receiving task doesn't
    have as much latency when it makes the receive call.  The
    converse algorithm requires all receivers to wait in turn
    as a single sender handshakes with each of the other tasks.

Date:   Fri Sep 24 14:11:43 2010 -0600

    Changes from Ryan Torn to remove the observation window and time
    override code.  This removes 'obs_window' from the input.nml namelist,
    and the executable no longer needs to read a time from the stdin.
    I also updated the documentation and moved all the scripting into
    a new shell_scripts directory to be more consistent with other
    parts of dart, and to make it easier to see how the scripts are
    intended to be used.
    
    The one not-backward-compatible part of this change is that you will
    need to remove 'obs_window' from your gps input namelist before you
    run again.

    Change the routine which returns the location of the state vector points.
    The original version only had the mass grid to work from, and so computed
    where the staggered points for the U and V grids should be.  However with
    a deformed grid these were not exactly in the right places.  The code was
    recently changed to read in the U and V staggered grids for writing to the
    output diagnostic files, so those grids are now available for use by this
    routine.  For the U and V staggers, look up the point locations directly
    in the arrays instead of doing a computation.
    
    note that this code is now more accurate, and the expected differences are
    slight, but it will NOT be bitwise reproducible with previous versions.
    in simple tests over the CONUS domain i saw differences in the output
    state space diagnostics of order 10e-4 in the U and V field values.

    Step toward support for the netCDF 4 libraries. netCDF 4 assigns file
    identifiers that do not fit in an "I3" format, so the format width is
    unspecified now (where possible) and I10 when it must be specified.
    There are a few more models&files that need to change, but there are other
    things to change in those models as well - for a different time.

    Added a readme to explain what these scripts are, and
    added the async 4 version of the run script.  i made it
    separate because it's a lot more complicated than the
    original run script, and most people executing this model
    to look at the assimilation will not want it.  however
    for debugging an installation or getting familiar with
    what's required for async 4, it has proven to be useful.

    Add code to optionally allow this executable to be
    compiled as an MPI job.  It's not really a true MPI
    executable in that sense that no matter how many tasks
    it is started with only task 0 runs the model.
    The other tasks hang out waiting for it to finish.
    But this allows integrate_model to be used to test
    async 4 and is fully backwards compatible.
    Also added some debug/trace messages which can be
    turned on at compile time to allow easier debugging
    if the model advances aren't working.

     - Added the staggered coordinate variables (XLONG_U_d0*, XLAT_U_d0*, XLONG_V_d0*, XLAT_V_d0*, ZNW_d0*)
     - Added additional attribute information, supporting long_name, description
    (same info as long_name which is the standard, but WRF calls this attribute
    'description'), units (previously supported) and named coordinates for the X
    and Y directions (in keeping with WRF, we do not name the vertical coordinate).

    Krikey ... patched sv_to_restart_file() so that it checks the size of the
    prognostic variable in memory - not the size of the netCDF variable - to
    allocate space for the variable. The start/count mechanism in the nf90_put_var()
    accounts for the fact you're stuffing a 3D variable into a 5D slot.
    
    Ran ncommas_to_dart, perfect_model_obs, and dart_to_ncommas cleanly.
    
    I also pruned out some unused variables as determined by the ifort compiler.

    "I think I had success with a single ob assimilated into a 5-member ensemble -- at least obs_seq.final says that values were changed between prior and posterior (below).  I noted similar-sized value changes just from manual perusing of the files.  There are a couple small fixes to the get_state_meta_data subroutine (in the attached diff file)."
    
    The patch file did not patch cleanly, so I had to do it by hand. Seemed obvious enough.

    Fixed index check so that get_state_meta_data() will not ignore
    (and sometimes error out on) the first index of a particular variable.

    The netcdf routines in model_mod.f90 are good to go.
    I compared the True_State.nc against the original wk01.000.nc
    and there were no differences. By extension, this also clears
    ncommas_to_dart.f90 since it was used to convert wk01.000.nc
    into perfect_ics to start off perfect_model_obs.

    The nc_write_model_atts() and nc_write_model_vars() routines
    are believed to be correct. The ll_to_xy and xy_to_ll routines
    were converting to radians twice (and converting back to degrees twice),
    which was causing incorrect values. That is believed to be fixed.

    Compiles with Intel 10.1 compiler. Added some kinds we have not encountered before,
    (these are not committed to obs_kind/DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90 yet) and am using
    13 types as the state variables.  Kind of a lot to start with.

    Made several changes to the processing of the HFR radial velocities.
    Ganesh Gopalakrishnan of Scripps made some changes to accomodate
    the checkpoint62a version of the MITgcm_ocean model on his platform,
    so I included some of those changes.
    
    The create_ocean_obs program now uses the temporal namelist settings
    to subset the incoming observation sequences. The example filenames
    for the HFRADAR data are more consistent with the other example filenames,
    and the obs_sequence_tool namelist now demonstrates how to consolidate
    multiple heterogeneous observation sequences into one.

    Added 3 generic parameter types.  These are not specific enough to
    be used for interpolation in cases where you have direct observations
    of the parms (use a more specific kind in that case).  They are
    intended for use where you have parameters in your state vector
    that will be adjusted by assimilation of other observations based
    on the covariances.

    Initial version of a run script for the NCAR Cray system
    called 'lynx'.  It is running the MOAB/Torque batch system,
    requires sh or ksh submit scripts, and does not mount the
    user home directories on the execution nodes.  The mpi
    run command is 'aprun'. Any files that need to be accessed
    after filter starts must be copied to /ptmp at the start
    of the script (or beforehand) before calling 'aprun'.
    Eventually this script should be generalized but it is
    finally working and i want it in subversion someplace!

    cleaned up the degrees/radian controversy. The beam angle is ALWAYS in degrees.
    It is read as degrees, written as degrees, interactively prompted for in degrees.
    When the get_expected_radial_vel() function is invoked, the angle is converted
    to radians as required by the Fortran trigonometric functions. All other times,
    all other places ... it is in degrees.

    Correcting the get_expected_radial_vel() routine. The angles are internally
    stored in degrees and must be converted to radians for use. It may be faster
    to store the values in radial_vel_data%beam_angle as radians - don't know
    how many times get_expetected_radial_vel() will call the same 'velkey'.
    
    Changed ALL occurrences of 'CODAR' to 'HFRADAR' to avoid using a
    company name.
    
    Changed namelist name to 'obs_def_ocean_nml' to be consistent with other
    module namelists. Moved the 'debug' option in get_expected_radial_vel() to
    to the module namelist.

    Change the write statement for the string 'obs_kind_definitions' back to
    using an explicit format so the chars start in column 1 of the obs_seq file.
    The current read code will read a string starting in either col 1 or 2,
    but previous read code will only work if the string starts in col 1.
    This change makes this code fully backwards compatible again.

    Removed some unused routines and variables.
    Made the required interface for get_close_obs() more closely
    match the required interface (variable names, mostly).
    This also now matches the documentation, which is hopefully
    consistent with other docs for get_close_obs().
    
    Fixed a problem in the DART netCDF files - the pop_in namelist
    file is preserved in a netCDF variable called 'pop_in' as
    opposed to POPnml (which means nothing to POP people).

    A proposed header change for our internal html doc pages,
    trying to make them look more like real web pages and less
    like raw information that wasn't intended for end users.
    There is a ton of great information in these files and if
    dressing them up just a little makes people look at them
    more, i think it's worth it.  I also added just a bit of
    info about the L63 model itself, with a public domain image.
    I'm expecting people to comment and decide to change this
    around, but it seemed like the easiest way to get people to
    look at it was to commit it and then revert it back if
    everyone hates it.  send me your feedback?  thanks, n.

    Changed run_filter to use 'ex' instead of some variant of 'vi' - and removed
    the whole 'vi' debacle. In both run_filter and advance_model - disposed of
    run-time unprintable character from 'ex' so it does not make its way into
    log files.
    
    Fixed the MPI commands in run_perfect_model_obs.batch.

    after finishing an assimilation, and correct the replace_wrf_fields docs
    to actually describe the correct program.  Fix the .nml file to have the
    namelist defaults that match the code.  Note that one of the two fieldname
    items need to be set before this program can run, but the source code
    does not have any default names built in so i'm following our convention
    of having the .nml files in the repository match the defaults in the code.

    This advances the LANL/POP 2_0_1 version of POP ... but still cannot be used
    for assimilation until the POP code is modified to do a forward euler
    timestep.  This compiles and runs on coral (SLES10) with the
    ifort (IFORT) 10.1 20090203 compiler with the following flags:
    FFLAGS = -O0 -fpe0 -vec-report0 -assume byterecl
    
    Coral is an Intel-based machine - so all binary files were little-endian.
    I like to append a ".le" suffix on those files.
    
    It was checked in the gx3v5 configuration.
    
    For coral with the openmpi framework, it is necessary to
    specify input.nml:&mpi_utilities_nml:reverse_task_layout = .true.,
    For bluefire ... it must be .false. (the default).

    write out UPPERCASE namelist names, which did not compare correctly to

    First draft of a script to plot multiple experiments on the same axis.
    This one is customized for POP in that the number of obs possible
    reflects the fact that we are not counting the observations if the
    forward operator can fail (DART QC==4) the only way that can happen
    is because an observation is too close to land to be interpolated
    (as opposed to extrapolated).

    Gave the 3D continents a translucent feature to help visualize
    observations over land (or close to land) - sometimes these were
    being masked by the solid continents (not good).
    As a side-effect, the OpenGL renderer is Matlab's default for
    translucent objects. This will result in printed figures at a
    fixed resolution (crummy fonts) and large files. It is possible
    to pick different renderers - at your own risk ...

    Updates from Kevin Raeder:
    
    full_experiment/analyses2initial.csh
      Check the CLM files for the existence/use of the FillValue attribute.
      If missing, add it to the appropriate variables of the whole ensemble.
      This allows ncea to correctly average fields which have a spval, but which is
      not identified as such.  The list of fields having spvals,
      ${CENTRALDIR}/clm_FillValue_fields, comes from clm_FillValue_vars.csh.
      Accomodate both CLM 3.5 and 3.6+ by testing for the existence of the
      additional fields in 3.6+.
      Archive the ensemble average of the iceinput_#.nc files as the "analysis" for the CICE model.
      Archive member 1 of the CICE and CLM restart files for comparison with ens. avg.
    
    full_experiment/clm_FillValue_vars.csh
      A new script to search a CLM restart(/initial) NetCDF file for variables
      which have the FillValue attribute.  This list is needed by analyses2initial.csh
      in order to correctly generate the ensemble average of the CLM files.
      I can handle any number of spvals and fields which use them.  The spvals are
      specified in the script.
    
    full_experiment/job_mpi.csh
      Smoother handling of nlevs for cam3.5 vs. cam3.6.
      Adapted to CICE restart files being available as NetCDF instead of binary.
      Augmented code which defines the obs_seq name to handle multiple years, leap years included.
    
    full_experiment/auto_diagPOP2ms_LSF.csh
      New variation of auto_diag2ms_LSF.csh to handle archiving of coupler history files
      needed to force POP assimilations.
      tcsh needed instead of csh to use :r, :e, etc. for handling cplr filenames.

    The xlf compiler has strict ideas about scope and won't let a non-module
    subroutine access a module global (which is irritatingly correct).  Add an
    accessor routine that the non-module exit routine can call to find out
    whether mpi has been initialized or not before trying to use the private
    communicator in the abort call.

    Add a namelist which allows for openmpi to work with async 4
    (the last task has to handshake with the script, instead of task 0).
    By default the namelist is DISABLED; you have to edit the file and
    turn 'use_namelist' to true to enable it.  This ensures 100%
    backwards compatibility.  Also removed some subroutine-local
    variables that duplicated a module global for controlling output;
    by default the handshake messages for async 4 will print, like
    before, but a separate module global flag controls it now.
    Also updated the comments at the head of the file, and removed
    an unused global variable.  And finally, make the exit routine
    not use the local communicator if we haven't been through the
    initialization routine (which is where it is created).

    The assimilation is working and the advance_model.csh script is working.
    I have to check the file motion from advance_model.csh ... might be leaving
    the tiegcm_restart_p.nc files in the advance directory without copying
    them to CENTRALDIR - impact on cycling?
    
    Must check that I did not break perfect_model_obs ... since advance_model.csh
    expects the tiegcm support files (tiegcm_restart_p.nc & tiegcm_s.nc) to be
    uniquely named in CENTRALDIR ...

    Adding a couple observation kinds for the COAMPS folks.
    Also took steps to ensure FORTRAN parameter names are less than
    the 32 character limit. This was potentially a problem when
    trying to 'build' horizontal wind names from the components.
    Had to change XXXXX_10_METER_HORIZONTAL_WIND (where XXXXX is the platform)
    to XXXXX_10_M_HORZ_WIND. Change was made consistent in obs_diag
    and should not affect any of the existing Matlab scripts.

    Ryan Torn's changes to add additional metadata to the netCDF diagnostic files when
    writing the state data as a single vector.  There is no change to the code in the more
    common case of breaking the state vector into the consitituent variables, U,V,T, etc
    and writing them in separate netCDF variables.  The new additional metadata records
    which variables are in the state vector, what order they are in, and what size they are.
    This allows a postprocessing program to extract the various fields at a later point.
    
    Also included in this commit is a minor rearrangment of where the module global variables
    are declared, to collect the 5 deprecated namelist items together with a comment about them
    having no impact on the code.  This has been true for a while now, but it wasn't as
    clear as it could have been that setting those items has no impact on the code.  Removing
    them from the namelist is a non-backwards-compatible change (users will get a fatal error
    at runtime if they remain in the users namelist), but they should be removed as soon as
    we freeze the code and make a release.

    This is the initial import of the TIEGCM interface. Tomoko and I are
    working on it on bluefire (IBM). At this point, perfect_model seems to
    be working correctly. We are working on the model_mod_check routine
    to ensure we can put a synthetic observation wherever we want, then
    we will test a single assimilation with no model advance. The model
    can be compiled as a single threaded executable, so we are checking
    async==2 first. After that works, we will explore async==4, the
    anticipated method for production runs.

    Forgot to add strings for new kinds to table.  This will eventually
    be autogenerated, once we have a way to input the 'master list' that
    works for everyone.  then we can autogenerate both the numbered parameter
    section at the top, and also the strings-to-numbers-and-back table.
    until then i have to remember that when i add a new parameter i also
    have to add a new line to the string table init code.

    The link_obs.m Matlab function is not specific to any one model.
    So - I am moving it from my test location to the production location.
    Simply a move - no other change.

    The scripts now appropriately put the land mask at the top or bottom,
    depending on the the 'which_vert' portion of the location AND some
    knowledge of the origin of the observation. At present observations
    of oceanic quantities (i.e. observations with a 'WOD observation' copy)
    get plotted with a Z label of 'depth' even though their which_vert
    is 'height' ... pretty tricksy. Atmospheric quantities are handled
    correctly, as far as I have been able to test.
    
    The figure with multiple panels is simpler, and the bottom graphic
    is generally a plot of the observation value vs. the ensemble mean estimate.
    If these things are alike, they line up on the diagonal.
    
    The summary of how many obs got rejected, etc. is ONLY echoed to
    the command window.

    The assimilate.csh script now transparently handles any prior or
    posterior inflation files - if they do not exist, the script
    carries on (without BREAKING!). These get renamed as needed.
    The logic of the script is that the 'latest'
    xxxx_inflation.DATE.restart.endian files are grabbed from the
    POP run directory and are linked as the appropriate
    xxxx_inflation_ics file.
    
    model_mod has a trivial change to print out the minimum value
    of 'max_reg_list_num' - needed when moving to a new grid.

    The tick marks should behave better. The original tickmarks and labels
    for the quantities being plotted are determined by matlab and annotated
    on the LEFT axis. These should always be 'nice'. The ticks
    for the number of observations plotted are chosen such that the
    ticks (and gridlines) are the same on both axes. The obs count
    ticklabels must be calculated ... these may not be very nice.
    
    The X ticks are the same on both the top and bottom axes.
    
    The X limits are adjusted to ensure a zero bias line is visible
    if 'bias' is one of the quantities. Previously, if the maximum bias
    was still negative ... zero would not be plotted.

    The 'time_to_skip' is correctly described as being the amount of time FROM
    THE LEADING EDGE OF THE FIRST BIN - not the bin 'center'. The logic of
    the programs has not changed, just the documentation. The matlab
    plotting scripts also act on the time appropriately.
    
    Additionally, the annotation of the input file at the bottom of the
    plot is now more robust and will correctly print the full name of
    the file no matter if the file is in the MATLABPATH, the local working
    directory, or is an absolute path.
    
    The obs_diag.f90 summary statistics (written to stdout & logfile) have
    a bit more verbosity about what sorts of DART QC flags were encountered.

    BUGFIX: Fixed logic for the case when multiple input files contribute to
    a single output file with the namelist variable 'append_to_netcdf' == .false.
    This situation incorrectly kept creating the output file for every input
    file - losing all previous observations.
    
    This has been a problem since version 4271 ... 12 February 2010.
    
    Renamed the output file to be 'obs_epoch_xxx.nc' to reinforce the notion that
    the obs_sequence file has no knowledge of any assimilation interval. It's just
    a span of time.
    
    The correction results in the following behavior:
    'append_to_netcdf' == .true.
            The output netcdf file (obs_epoch_xxx.nc) is simply appended.
            If it exists before the execution of the program - and the metadata
            is compatible with the current execution - the file simply gets bigger.
            No matter how many input files are read - they all get appended to
            the (possibly pre-existing) output file for that epoch.
    
    'append_to_netcdf' == .false.
            Any pre-existing output file is obliterated.
            No matter how many input files are read - they all get appended to
            the output file appropriate for that epoch.

    Added fields to the output structure: "numZtypes", "Zpositivedir", and "Zunits"
    
    numZtypes will be 1 for a single observation level coordinate system, but since
    the routine can return 'ALL' observations, this may be larger than 1.
    
    Zpositivedir will be either 'up' or 'down' ... large positive numbers should be
    at the top of the Z axis for 'up' and at the bottom for 'down'.
    
    Zunits is unbelievable, since observation sequence files do not retain units.
    Right now, the acceptable values are 'undefined','surface','pressure','level','depth'
    I'm not telling ...

    This version is the tested implementation of the 'distributed'
    pop_to_dart and dart_to_pop conversions. They are all run in
    the background and progress is controlled with a simple unix 'wait'.
    Because each of the conversions happens in its own directory,
    a few changes had to be added to let 'filter' work - the remnant
    pop_in and pop.r.nc files (previously from pop_to_dart) had to
    linked in the assimilation directory.
    
    With 48 members - running on one node - it cuts about 8 minutes
    off the execution time - not bad.

    When skipping an observation for any reason the code has to
    goto 200 (the bottom of the loop) and not directly back to 10
    (the top of the loop) or it might read past the end of the
    input file and crash in the prepbufr libs.
    
    Also wrapped 2 lines that were longer than 72 chars. these
    are fixed-format files and without extra flags to extend the
    input line length, with at least one compiler characters
    beyond column 72 were silently ignored. in both cases it
    was a debug print message that isn't called unless you
    turn a local debugging variable on.  what was annoying was
    that what was being ignored was the value of interest it
    was supposet to be printing.

    The README has notes for how to configure/start/continue an experiment
    using the paired CAM DATM fields for POP.
    
    The assimilate.csh script preserves different node configurations we
    had tried for running DART on a different number of nodes than POP
    (even though CCSM is controlling both) - and this version records
    the initial attempt at distributing the pop_to_dart and dart_to_pop
    portions. Collectively, these were taking about 10 minutes for a
    48member ensemble. Hopefully, using all the CPUs on a node will reduce
    that ...

    All functions that create vertical profiles now use the same methodology
    for creating the axes. All functions also annotate the files used in
    the plotting as teeny tiny text at the bottom of the figure.
    The range of time that was used in the averaging is also annotated
    in the xlabel - and now properly reflects the 'time_to_skip' attribute
    that was used when obs_diag was run.

    The two_experiments_profile.m script is ready for friendly testing.
    The script will plot up to 4 regions on one 'figure' for a particular
    variable and quantity (i.e. 'rmse' or 'bias') for either the prior
    or posterior or both. The number of observations for each experiment
    are overlain. The captions and labelling are 'optimized' for each
    subplot configuration.
    
    The GetNCindices functions had to be extended to return indices for
    any desired region.
    
    Future work ... when plotting 4 regions, the legend takes up too
    much space. the current workaround is to only plot the priors -
    that way we don't have to create legend items for the posteriors.

    This is a prototype function for plotting the results of two
    experiments. You can select to plot just the priors or posteriors, any
    number of variables, ... Right now, it is best for simply one region.
    I have not explored multiple regions - which are planned to be plotted
    on the same 'figure' as subplots.
    
    This also needs to have the filenames annotated along the bottom.

    Change default output filename in marine converter to 'obs_seq.marine',
    and make the same change in the default marine obs_seq name in the
    wrf_dart_obs_preprocess program.  Also fixed a cut-n-paste error in
    the windowing script where i had ASEC in two different places instead
    of ADAY, and finally fix the input filename to prepend the directory
    path in the madis_conv.csh script.
    Thanks to Soyoung for finding the scripting problems and suggesting
    the output name change to make it consistent with the other converters.

    No longer requires an analysis time as input (still does require 4 logicals to
    control which obs to process), and updated path_names file to use the routines
    in the obs_utilities_mod.

    Most recent update from Ryan - the date should be input as a gregorian
    day number/seconds, and internally it uses append or insert with prev
    to speed up building a new obs sequence.

    An example of a simple text-to-obs_seq file converter.
    Intended to be used as a template for users with text
    data.  Users with data already in netCDF or HDF would do
    better to start with the MADIS converters as a template.

    Updates from Ryan Torn; the obs_window setting applies to all types
    if set.  Otherwise, there are windows per observation type if you
    want to restrict the obs to closer to the analysis time.

commit b3b0e72f9a63a8a2551d481c3cc85ff3691e0934
Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Fri Mar 26 15:32:33 2010 -0600

    Major revision to the converters.  Common code pulled out into new
    obs_utilities_mod.f90, which eventually may move up another level
    to be common across all types of observations.  Added makefiles for
    the advance_time and obs_sequence_tool executables.  The converters
    no longer have times or windows as inputs; they convert all obs in
    the input file to the output, and keep the original obs times.
    The rawinsonde converter still needs 2 logicals for whether to output
    the significant level data or not.  Also added some scripts to show
    how these might be used in converting a large number of obs.
    There is a corresponding change to the wrf preprocessor to accomodate
    the obs having different times.  It now needs an analysis time as input.
    Thanks to Ryan and Glen for new code, and thanks to them and Rahul
    for testing.

    These are slightly less ancient, but nonetheless fundamentally untested.
    They are syntactically OK, logically is another matter. Their origin is
    lost - these should be considered as a decent starting point _only_
    I simply removed dependencies on unsupported toolboxes and replaced them
    with supported calls.

    These routines are ANCIENT - they use netCDF variables with a 'state'
    variable (i.e. it has not been parsed into prognostic variables). All I
    did was replace the now-unsupported getnc() and netcdf_toolbox() functions
    with the equivalent snctools() functions. There is no telling if these
    ever worked, or if they work now ... I felt compelled to update them in
    the face of the new release.

    These routines are no longer needed.
    trans_time.f90 and nmlbld_rose.f90 have been
    incorporated into the dart_to_model.f90 code.
    The trans_perfect_ics.f90 functionality is totally
    duplicated in model_to_dart.f90 - by simply renaming
    the hardwired output filename ...

    Methodological cleanup.
    1) use get_model_size from model_mod.f90 (not assim_model_mod - simpler)
    2) removed need for 'trans_time' and 'nmbld' programs by incorporating
       these functions into dart_to_model. This required a new routine
       model_mod:update_ROSE_namelist and the valid_time of the model state
       is now part of the model_type declaration. The rose namelist now
       only exists in model_mod.f90.
    3) removed need for 'trans_perfect_ics' as it is exactly the same as
       model_to_dart.f90 except for a different output filename.
    4) the new model_mod:*_ROSE_restart routines are believed to be working.
    5) the advance_model.csh script reflects the simpler time management and
       rose.nml namelist (written by dart_to_model).
    6) the run_perfect_model_obs.csh script reflects the fact that model_to_dart
       can do what trans_perfect_ics used to do.
    
    After I chat with Tomoko, I will delete the superfluous routines.

    Changed the legend format. Moved the summary statistics to be part of the
    title - removed some of the axis labelling clutter. Also prints the full path
    of the input file at the bottom of the page. Added feature to be able to
    plot just one observation type instead of ALL the observation types in the file.
    Also prints out a separate file for each observation type with summary
    observation counts by QC flag, etc - for each level.

    These functions differ from the standard functions in that the number of
    observations 'possible' reflects the fact that observations rejected
    because of the incoming QC value are not really 'possible' to be assimilated.
    Additionally, for the POP model, the only reason the forward operator
    can fail is because the observation is between land and a grid point -
    extrapolation rather than interpolation. These observations are also not
    included in the count of observations 'possible'.

    Add error checks to be sure the number of obs passed to get_close_obs()
    is the same number as was passed into get_close_obs_init().
    The rules are they need to be identical lists; we can't cheaply test for
    that but at least we can be sure the sizes match.  If they aren't the
    same the 3d sphere code isn't going to return the right thing.
    For all the other types of locations it would have just iterated
    past the end of a list or not done the whole list.  At least this
    check completely fixes that latter possibility.

    Updated documentation; added an introduction, added usage examples

    Added documentation on new optional arguments to the read/write routines.
    Added missing documentation where some routines had nothing
    at all.  Probably still stuff to do, but much more accurate than before.

    Two birds with one stone; don't overwrite pert_state with missing_r8
    because that's bad, and by using 'state' you avoid the unused variable
    compiler warning.  (This usage didn't hurt any code because a utility
    using the template model_mod better just be using it to satisfy external
    symbols so it compiles and not because it is expected to do anything real.)

    Adding files needed by the Intel compiler, but don't seem
    to be needed by the PG compiler. Curious. All targets
    compile at this point (even the ones not listed below -
    they already worked).

    Incorporated the model_interpolate routine (from lightning) and
    removed all the unused variables. Now uses the netCDF F90 interface
    exclusively. Need to check the get_state_meta_data() routine ...
    for var_type information.

    Adding required targets.
    Reflects work by Tim & Tomoko to bring model up-to-date
    and remove reliance on filter_server.csh scripting-type
    parallelism. Renamed trans_sv_pv to dart_to_model,
    renamed trans_pv_sv to model_to_dart. Easy.

    I made a copy of trans_time which doesn't use the model
    init code, and opens the file itself so it should work
    for any model.  I put it here for people porting new models
    to use as a template.  There is a README telling how it
    can be compiled and tested here in this directory.

    are counted, when deciding to reduce the threshold.  There
    are two new namelist items in the &assim_tools_nml namelist

    Small functional change for all the location_mods, but large amounts of code
    reformatting, bringing infrequently used location types up to date
    with current code, making versions internally consistent with each
    other, and minor bug fixes in little-used types of locations.  This is a
    combination of work from nancy and Tim.  Details follow (and sorry they
    got pretty long, but i believe they're accurate).
    
    - added the option to format a location into a human-friendly ascii format,
    independent of which location module is being linked with.  useful for code
    which needs to stay location-independent, such as generic tools.
    
    - removed 'simple_threed_sphere' which was only different from the full
    'threed_sphere' in that the vertical could only be one type.  added a
    'twod' type, which is a periodic (x,y) location in the domain [0-1] in
    both dimensions.
    
    - added netcdf write routines which have the same calling interface for
    all types of locations.  opens the right dimensionality arrays, and
    writes into them with an appropriate set of attributes.  useful for code
    that wants to store a list of locations in a netcdf file but needs to
    work with multiple location types (like generic tools).
    
    - renamed the internal location derived type variables in the annulus
    to be azm and rad (azimuth and radius), instead of lat and lon.  it makes
    the code clearer as to what is being used for what.  also added a missing
    namelist that the comments indicated should be there, for min and max
    values of the radius, and added the code to enforce those limits.
    
    - changed the default format for writing ascii locations to be 16 decimal
    digits instead of 14.  this is intended to avoid problems with roundoff
    error.  note that this will change, very slightly, the numeric values
    if you read/write locations in ascii -- but in my tests they now match
    more closely the actual machine values that you'd get if you read/wrote
    in binary format.
    
    - made all the code call a consistent routine in the utilities module
    to decide if the intent is to write locations in ascii or binary.
    the default code is now in a single place instead of being implemented
    in every different location module.  uses the 'ascii_file_format()'
    function from the utilities_mod.
    
    - the interactive_locations subroutine no longer suggests hectopascals
    as the units for the vertical if you give a vertical type of 'surface'.
    many users create surface observations with a numerical value of meters,
    so they can compute differences between observations which should be
    located at the surface and where the model thinks the surface is.
    users can continue to input pressure if they want.  they will need to
    input it as pascals instead of hectopascals, and the prompting text
    will no longer suggest which units should be used.
    
    - any generic utility can call the 'vert_is_xxx()' functions and
    even if the locations module has no vertical component it will return
    false, so utility code can be compiled independently of the locations
    module it is linked with.
    
    - the order of the subroutines and functions in the code has been
    made consistent between each location module, so it's easier to
    use diff and xdiff between different types of locations modules.
    now for the most part only actual code differences will be found,
    instead of comments, white space, and order of code in the source.
    
    - added an overloaded set_location() routine that takes a fortran
    array of values, to set a single location in an location-independent
    form.  the code checks for the proper number of input arguments in
    the list, and then calls the standard set_location() to do the actual
    work.  this allows generic tools to pass through things from a namelist
    which are appropriate for different location types without needing
    special case code.
    
    - the 2 kind arguments to get_close() are marked as optional, so the
    routine can be called with them but they aren't required inside the
    location modules - none of the standard code uses the kinds.  user code
    can intercept this call and is welcome to require and use the kinds,
    but the location code in the location_mod does not need them.
    
    - added code to make the 'is_location_in_region()' function do an
    accurate computation for annulus, column, and the twod_sphere versions.
    
    - removed obsolete 'alloc_get_close_type()' functions in some of the
    little-used location mod types, and added versions of the current
    collection of get_close_type functions.
    
    - made the get_close_type private, since no other code outside the
    location_mod should be able to access the contents of the derived type.
    
    - added test directories and test cases for each of the location types.
    the 'location_test.f90' source is at the top level directory, and the
    'testall.csh' script will run the tests for each of the locations types.

    Reordered some variable declarations to match the calling order,
    made all the error messages use a consistent year/month/day...
    order (which matches the calling order)
    The only possibly user-visible change is in set_date_gregorian,
    which now uses a methodology consistent with all the other calendars
    i.e. it no longer calls set_time()

    Updated wrf model_mod:
    
    Contains Ryan's new vortex center-finding code and a max
    surface height difference limit.  The default is to use the old code
    so it's backwards compatible; edit the code and set 'use_old_vortex'
    to .false. to try the new vortex code.  The default for the surface
    height limit is -1, which disables the check so it's also backwards
    compatible.
    
    New namelist items:  sfc_elev_max_diff, circulation_pres_level, and
    circulation_radius.  see docs for usage.
    
    The routine which tests the height difference between the model surface
    and the elevation of a surface observation is called 'height_diff_check'
    and is public.
    
    The sizes of local variables inside the spline routines have been
    increased.
    
    The old vortex code has changed in one place - if the center is located
    on any of the edges of the search box, the forward operator will return
    a failure code instead of returning success and the same location as
    the incoming observation.
    
    Other changes:
    
    input.nml - the radar section has been updated; _r8 is not legal on
    numeric constants in a namelist file.  each namelist is terminated
    by a slash on a separate line in a consistent column.  two new
    sections have been added:  &dart_to_wrf_nml and &replace_wrf_fields_nml.
    see the docs for use.
    
    dart_to_wrf - requires a namelist now.  the namelist settings allow
    restart files to be converted to wrf netcdf files for continuing with
    a free run after an assimilation.
    
    replace_wrf_fields - a fortran version of the ncl scripts which
    take 2 netcdf files and replace the fields from one into the other.
    namelist options control which fields are copied, and whether a
    missing field is simply skipped or becomes a fatal error.  the
    field names can either be specified directly in the namelist or

commit bdf531f3206278c131b1384a04376347d17af16e
Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Tue Feb 16 13:46:34 2010 -0700

    Updates to the MADIS converters:  whether or not the QC values
    are in the files is detected at runtime.  There is a internal
    variable which can be set at compile time to force the programs
    to ignore QC fields even if present and use all observations,
    but by default the QC will be used if it exists.
    
    The single surface converter has been split into two versions;
    one which reads the standard METAR files and one which reads
    the very similar but slightly different Mesonet files.
    
    Add the additional METAR_ALTIMETER and METAR_ moisture
    types.  For now, THERE ARE NO MESONET_xxx types -- i still haven't
    gotten a clear consensus on whether this was desired or not.
    For now, this version of the MESONET converters will use LAND_SFC_
    as the output type for mesonet files.

Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Tue Feb 16 13:36:48 2010 -0700

    This program is about to be replaced by 2 other separate
    programs -- one for official METAR files from MADIS, and
    another for generic mesonet files which have slight but
    significant differences that make it simpler to keep separate
    executables.  But I did add the auto-detect code for whether
    the QC fields existed here, and before I delete this file
    if we ever want to resurrect this program I want to have
    the code stored in the repository.

    Move the NCEP PREPBUFR converter from ncep_obs to under
    the observations/NCEP directory.  I left a README in the
    old location pointing to the new location.  In the new
    directory, the prepbufr code from NCEP is at the same level
    as a new 'ascii_to_obs' dir which is where the create_real_obs
    program, which reads ascii lines of text and outputs a
    dart obs_seq file, is stored.  I've updated the docs to match
    the new locations.

    I figured CAM might as well have the 'native' ability to build the
    executable - since WRF and POP already have it.
    
    The observations/utilities/threed_sphere/quickbuild.csh will build
    it for all models that use 3D location types.

    Encapsulated the netcdf location operations.
    Added interface procedure for set_location() such that you
    can pass it an array of values to set a single location or
    you can pass the appropriate number of args to set a single location.
    This way the same interface can be used by multiple location modules.

    Some of our URL lines are getting expanded to be longer than the default
    line length limit of 132 chars.  This flag makes it compile again.  The
    longer term plan is to start using the Id tag instead of the URL, but
    this should be a short-term fix for now.  Also, I have needed to compile
    with -lnetcdff as well as -lnetcdf on several platforms, so i'm adding
    in the extra flag here to help people get linked.  Recent versions of the
    netcdf libs are building the f90 interfaces in a separate library.

    In normal use identical to previous versions.  Has some better error checking,
    and cosmetic changes in the output for easier reading.  Combination of changes
    from Kevin and Nancy:
    
    - change a couple E_MSG to E_ERR so code will stop if these cases are reached.
    - make errstring a module global and remove it as a local variable in a bunch
       of the subroutines.
    - fix cosmetic formatting of debugging/diagnostic messages to the log and to stdout.
    - only print first, last values in the coord arrays; avoids long lines.
    - change convert_vert initializers of local vars to be MISSING_I and then change
       tests to look for that and not 0.  should catch any case where the values are
       unset (shouldn't happen).
    - add case in convert_vert if height > top of model; previously would have done
       a bad interpolation.  enable an output message to the log if this happens so
       it can be tracked.

    read_obs_netcdf  no longer has a 'maxQC' argument, nor will it
    return observations subsetted based on maxQC. The routine is more
    useful if it returns all the observations and you can query based
    on any/all QC value(s).
    
    The plotting routines now have a 'twoup' flag so you can plot the
    observations above and the QC values below.
    
    The linked_observations() function now plots a scatterplot of
    the observation value vs. prior ensemble mean (for example).
    
    GetNCindices is one step closer to recognizing WRF coordinate variables.

    The 'msread' command has become obsolete; 'msrcp' exists
    but doesn't understand the cosblocking arg.  now for the
    older prepbufr files, you have to run 'cosconvert' as a
    separate second step.  These are the updated docs from
    glen on how to do it with mcrcp and cosconvert.

    This is a prototype function that creates a scatterplot of 'prior ensemble mean' vs.
    the actual observation value, for example. They should line up on the diagonal.
    There are a lot of hardwired parts to the function ... for now.
    I need to add a little more functionality before cleaning it up.

    The converter had been caching the previous obs time within
    an individual profile, but using insert without a previous obs
    for each new profile  Since most of the input files are already
    sorted by time, speed up the convertion by caching the last obs
    time even between profiles. It gives a huge performance gain,
    especially as these files get very large.

    Major change: calls to the error_handler() can have up to 3 lines of text
    to be printed out.  Also fixes some internal comments which were misleading.
    And finally, calls to timestamp() with 'end' as the type will call the
    standard finalize_utilities() routine, and code will be encouraged to
    call finalize directly from here on out.  It now takes an optional program
    name argument, to match init, which it will print out in the log in
    the final timestamp.

    You cannot set the second arg of pert_model_state() to junk;
    in at least one place the caller is passing in the real state
    vector as both arg 1 and arg 2 - overwriting it with junk
    corrupts the actual state vector data.  we'll just have to put
    up with a compiler warning about not setting an intent(out)
    argument  (or we could set pert_state to state - unnecessary work
    but at least safe).

    NbadUV
    NbadLV
    rmse

    N_DARTqc_1
    N_DARTqc_2
    N_DARTqc_3
    N_DARTqc_4
    N_DARTqc_5
    N_DARTqc_6
    N_DARTqc_7
    
    which can be plotted with the usual diagnostics/matlab routines.
    So - now it is possible to not only plot the bias as a function of height,
    you can now plot the (mean) observation value as a function of height.
    Additionally, obs_diag and the associated plotting functions
    also support observations on model levels (curious obs).

    Add the 'ascii_file_format()' function, which returns whether you're
    writing an unformatted/binary file or a formatted/ascii/text file.
    It makes the handling of 'UNF' 'unf' 'UNFORMATTED', etc all happen
    in a single routine for consistency.

    Reworked by Josh Hacker, Ryan Torn, and Glen Romine to add function and
    simplify the script.  It now supports a restart-file-per-member, simplifies
    the time computations by using the advance_time executable, and handles
    boundary files more cleanly.  Plus added many additional comments, and ways
    to select various options by setting shell variables at the top of the script.

    Update from Ryan.  This version reads in the data qc values,
    and prompts the user for the minimum acceptable qc value.
    If the incoming data has a qc below the minimum, it will be
    discarded and not placed in the output file.
    All obs in the output file will continue to have a fixed
    data qc of 1 (which is not a change - it did this before).

    Adds support for several WRF fields needed for more complicated

    fixes for the single column model from Josh; move precip output
    code for Ryan up into the right code block.  Removed some

    Updates from Glen to handle different types of radar

    fall velocity.  Includes a couple new namelist items
    and documentation.  There may be additional changes

    Added support to output forward operator errors, similar to

    to users to debug model_interpolate() errors here, with a
    single task, single ensemble member program.  Also made the
    trace messages match more with filter, and documented in the
    html and nml files the additional namelist items.  No change
    in functionality.

    Updated version of this converter, and additional shell scripts
    to help automate obs conversions.  There are date fixes in this
    code which were confirmed to be input data errors or conversion
    errors from the data providers.  This version includes obs error
    values settable by namelist, more output about what incoming QC
    values were encountered, and more testing/debugging options.
    Also fixed a bug where the temperature QC had been applied to
    the salinity obs.  Added a README to describe where the data
    files came from, and some simple suggestions for the expected
    workflow here.

    obs_seq_to_netcdf    now uses the same namelist strategy as obs_diag.
    Namely, if specified "obs_sequence_name" will act in the 'usual' way -
    either reading a single file or trying to increment the directory to
    get more files. If 'obs_sequence_list' is specified - it contains the
    name of the file containing a list of files to be processed.
    
    Only ONE of obs_sequence_name or obs_sequence_list may be 'non-null'.
    
    all namelists that had a obs_seq_to_netcdf namelist were
    updated to reflect the new namelist parameter.

    Extended the 3D version of obs_diag to be able to read a list of
    filenames as well as the 'status quo' of a single filename and
    a filename that is part of a sequence. There is a new namelist
    parameter 'obs_sequence_list' that is the name of a file containing
    the list of filenames to process. 'obs_sequence_file' still exists,
    and defaults to 'obs_seq.final'. One of 'obs_sequence_file' or
    'obs_sequence_list' MUST be an empty string.
    
    Changed the documentation and the default input.nml settings
    for those models that use the threed_ version of obs_diag.

    large file support for netCDF
    the list-of-files namelist var for obs_seq_to_netcdf,

    These things are pervasive in some model_mods ... and may not match the

    for accessing derived type members instead of the fortran

    POP actually drags around 'PSURF' as a state variable, not 'SHGT' (sea surface height).
    Renamed the DART state variable accordingly and added the ability (albeit untested) to
    convert the interpolated PSURF to a SHGT when model_interpolate() is asked to return a
    KIND_SEA_SURFACE_HEIGHT. The POP restarts (and now DART) use PSURF.
    
    run_perfect_model_obs.batch   has error exits if pop_to_dart or perfect_model_obs fails.

    Reduced the verbosity of the run-time output.
    pop_to_dart and dart_to_pop now work very nearly silently.
    If more verbosity is required, change the logical variable 'verbose'
    in the program code. It cannot be made a namelist variable because
    utilities_mod:initialize_utilities() must be called with a verbose
    flag ... before the program namelists can be read! Darn.
    
    The assimilate.csh script also exits with an error if any of the
    elements fails (pop_to_dart, filter, dart_to_pop).

    More updates from Kevin Raeder:
    
    full_experiment/auto_diag2ms_LSF.csh
       Edited output to saved_diagnostics to be more informative.
       Uncommented 'rm H* cam_analyses.tar' to prevent excessive build-up
           of disc usage.
       Code to handle any number of Hhh directories via a list in file
          'hdir_names'.  This is also used by analyses2initial.csh.
       More careful handling of tar and msrcp of cam_analyses file.
    
    full_experiment/job_mpi.csh
       Fixed quoting error introduced with version 3649.
       Added code to check for correct CLM file handling.
       Changed 'while' loop to allow assimilations longer than 1 year.
       Added $$ to MASTERLOG name so that a job_mpi.csh can be submitted
         for a new batch while the previous batch is still running.
       Fixed indenting of clm_option section.
       Added definition of ICE model namelist variables sst, str_yr_first,
         str_yr_last.
       Added switch to control archiving of CAM history (h0) files.
       Removed cam_version (user set) in favor of model_version (read
         from input.nml.
    
    shell_scripts/advance_model.csh
       Made handling of ICE files backwards compatible with CAMs < 3.6.0,
         which don't deal with such files.
       Added switch to control archiving of CAM history (h0) files,
         which is passed to other scripts via file 'casemodel'.
    
    shell_scripts/run-cam.csh
       Made handling of ICE namelist arguments backwards compatible with
          CAMs < 3.6.0...
       Added bomb-proofing to moving of initial file names; '.' became
          '\.' to prevent . being expanded as 'single character'.
       Accommodated CLM 3.5 switch to using .r. files as initial files,
          rather than .i..
       Added switch to control archiving of CAM history (h0) files.

    This uses some 'standard' filenames to ease the scripting.
    Ran a weeklong 'perfect_model_obs' case and generated observations-
    assimilated daily.  (Intel 10.1 compiler on Coral ... 16CPU gx3v5 case)
    Also ran a 15 day model advance every 5 days with a daily model
    increment.
    
    The run_filter script is still under development, so no actual model advancing
    assimilation yet..

    Better metadata checking (across incoming observation sequence files).
    Previous version exploited a 'feature' of one particular compiler,
    and was, in general, wrong. Caused an immediate failure if more than
    one observation sequence file was ingested (unless, of course, you were
    using the one compiler....)

    The 'bad' observations QC plot now :
    1) plots a little description of each DART QC value in the legend,
    2) the symbol colors represent the QC value, not the observation value, and
    3) the levels annotated in the title now reflect the levels of the 'bad'
       observations, not the 'good' observations.
    
    plot_obs_netcdf.m and read_obs_netcdf.m both check
    for the existence of the file before trying to read from it.

    Add QVAPOR to the default field list; otherwise vertical profiles cannot
    be computed because pressure and height calcs need this.  Note that with
    the default list you cannot interpolate all obs types (e.g. surface pressure
    or altimeter) but you can interpolate temperature, and winds.

    Another update from Kevin:
    
    In get_close_obs:
      Added feature to restrict impact of a kind of observation
         to other obs and state variables of the same kind.
         That kind is listed in the model_nml variable impact_only_same_kind.
      Fixed bug which excessively damped influence of obs with VERTISUNDEFINED
         (vert location = -888888) on state variables higher than the threshold.
      Lots of diagnostic output statements are commented out.

    CAM updates from Kevin:
    
    advance_model.csh
       Added (CAM 3.6) ICE restart file handling.
       Adapted to changes in file "casemodel" for ICE.
    
    run-cam.csh
       Added (CAM 3.6) ICE restart file handling.
       Adapted to changes in file "casemodel" for ICE.
       Added handling of CAM history file *.h0.*
       Added handling of ICE namelist via build-namelist.
    
    job_mpi.csh
       Added (CAM 3.6) ICE restart file handling.
       Adapted to changes in file "casemodel" for ICE.
       Added handling of CAM history file *.h0.*
       Made finding namelistin more automatic.
       Accomodated 30 levels for CAM > 3.6.0
       Added CLM ensemble averaging capability (clm_ens_avg)
    
    auto_diag2ms_LSF.csh
       Added code to archive CAM history files (*.h0.*)
       Handles CLM ensemble averaged files.
       More robustly handles varying numbers of H## analyses directories.
    
    auto_re2ms_LSF.csh
       Added code to handle ICE restarts.
       Made assembly of list of files to archive more compact.
    
    analyses2initial.csh
       Replaced the snow/water field averaging by NCO (ncap2 script)
         with f90 program models/cam/clm_ens_avg.f90.
       Generalized the listing of the H## files to be processed.
       Generalized the program to handle eulerian or FV (staggered U,V_) CAM files.
       Added code to pick one ICE ensemble member to be the "analysis".
    
    models/cam/clm_ens_avg.f90
       New program to correctly average the snow and related water fields in an
       ensemble of CLM initial files (both CLM3 and CLM3.6).  Each ensemble member
       can have a different number of snow layers, but the corresponding top layers
       live in different indices in the file.  So they must be realligned, then
       averaged, then the result put back in to the right index.
       The resulting averaged snow layers may not be "full", but CLM can handle that.
       Columns with miniscule amounts of snow have the snow quantities zeroed.

    This seems to be working, except that the observation errors are
    hardcoded right now (to 2 degrees).   Updated the doc file to

    The grid information is not in the LANL-POP restart file, so it must be
    read from the binary grid files.  Removed the DART namelist dependence on
    grid file information ... the grid file names come from the pop_in namelist.
    The dart_to_pop.f90 program writes a pop_in.DART namelist that contains the
    new 'stop' information (from the advance_to_time). The dart_to_pop.f90
    program also has a logical namelist input such that it can read dart ics files

    Add mkmf and path_names files for the time utility which uses the DART
    time manager internally to do all time calculations.  Many of the WRF
    scripts use as similar program advance_cymdh, but it does it's own time
    computation and should be deprecated.  The format of the time strings is
    almost identical between the two programs, but this version reads the args
    from standard input, while the wrf utility tries to parse command line args,
    which is not portable across all our supported platforms.  so the difference
    in usage is:  advance_cymdh 2006090100 +1d
    vs: echo 200609010 +1d | ./advance_time

    Template files which have the right syntax for various shells.  Useful for
    tasks which have a start year/month/day and stop year/month/day, and need
    to loop over the days doing some kind of file manipulation.
    Add your own code in the middle to do multi-day file processing, using
    whichever of the shell variables are useful to you.
    Also computes the gregorian day which is often useful in DART namelists.
    Requires the advance_time executable and a corresponding input.nml to exist
    in the current directory.  The $DART/observations/gps/work directory has
    a version of the mkmf and path_names files needed to build that executable,
    which you can copy to whereever you are using these files.

    Important bug fix:  correct the standard deviation passed into
    the random_gaussian() routine.  From revision 3871 until now
    (11 may, 2009 to 25 aug, 2009) observations were generated
    from a distribution which was much too wide (the square of
    the sd was being used instead of the sd).  The true obs value
    was correct, as was the variance written into the output obs
    files, but the random observation value would have been much
    further away from the truth than it should be.

    Move the contents of the top level 'converters' directory to a subdirectory

    Updated COSMIC GPS RO converter.  Does a series of files in one execution;
    has separate scripts for download vs conversion.  Also added the advance_time
    path_names file.  This version of advance_time does require a DART input.nml
    file to exist in the current directory; i hope to make a version which will
    not need one so the time converter is easier to run stand-alone.  Also
    updated the doc html file.

    Glen and I added code to allow reflectivity kinds to be interpolated,
    and allowed them to be gracefully failed if no reflectivity fields
    are in the state vector.  the default obs_kind mod for radar first
    tries to interpolate reflectivity directly, and then backs off
    and tries to compute it from the other fields if necessary.
    
    Also removed the remaining dependance on nmoist and surf_obs
    from the namelist. Renamed QGRAUPEL to QGRAUP in code to match
    the actual name of the field in the wrf netcdf files.
    And finally, added a lot more checks to be sure the starting
    index is valid before using it to access into the state vector.

    Integrated all Jeff's dipole interpolation code.  The standard
    POP grid is a shifted pole grid where the poles are over land
    and so lots of ugly interpolation problems can be avoided.
    
    Also commit a test subroutine and test driver.  The test program
    needs data files, which will be tar'd and put on the web site
    along with a readme here to explain how to get them.

    Removing dependency on CSIRO (getnc) and netcdf_toolbox.
    These now only depend on the snctools toolbox. The syntax
    is different for snctools:nc_varget() and CSIRO:getnc(),
    so there were a lot of changes. Also took the opportunity
    to remove (all? of) the variable dimension order
    assumptions.

    Finally - i've taken the advance_time program that is a derivative
    of one from wrf, and i've made it use our time manager to do the
    calendar computations.  This version differs from the original in
    that it expects to read a single line of input from the terminal,
    so it needs to be called like one of these:
     echo '20080101 24' | advance_time
    or
     echo '20080101 24' > foo
     advance_time < foo
    or
     advance_time
     20080101 24
    or
     advance_time <<EOF
     20080101 24
     EOF
    
    The earlier version of this program read command line args,
    but that code is NOT portable between different fortran compilers,
    so made my own arg parse routine which works on any input line
    and breaks it into space-separated strings.

    Added a fix to the routine which was supposed to help users figure out
    what was wrong if they were unable to assimilate a particular observation
    kind because the state vector was missing a required data type.  It was
    looping up to the number of types, not kinds.  It also had a logic error
    in trying to validate indirect kinds like the vortex obs.  Getting this new
    wrf model_mod requires updating to the new obs_kind template as well.
    Added two new accessor functions to the kind module which return the obs
    kind counts and the obs type counts.

    This version tries to read in KMT and KMU, but if they aren't there,
    tries to read in HT and HU.  HT and HU are real, not integer, and
    have the lowest valid depth in cm.  The code changes them into index
    numbers (and so relies on a valid vert_depth file), so KMT and KMU
    are the arrays which should be used, even if they were computed from
    H arrays.

    Completely artifical fix for now; if the restart files have a year
    of 0 (which the calendar does not allow), set it to year 1.  But this
    must be fixed in another way before we support longer than a 1 year
    run starting at 0.  Presumably with real observations, the dates must
    be set to times matching the observation times and this won't be a problem.

    Updates to model_mod to fix vertical interpolation (larger positive numbers

    adjust the amount of debugging output printed.  Added options to try to determine
    radians or degrees automatically (assumes global grid).  Look for either i,j
    or nlon,nlat for dimensions in the grid defns.  Re-enabled the building of the
    rest of the utils in the quickbuild script, and minor updates to the input namelist.

    Allow 'output_interval' to be set to 0 without a core dump. Make
    trace messages more parallel to the ones in filter.  Most of the
    time perfect_model runs fast enough you don't care, but if the
    forward operators are slow, it could be useful to have timestamp
    information.  Added the option to print after every Nth obs is
    evaluated.

    changes to the code to pull all the execution trace labels into a
    single subroutine; and use the relatively recent 'brief' format for

    makes them more grep-friendly.

    Everything compiles on coral with Intel 10.1.
    
    The pop_to_dart code runs and is to be thoroughly checked by the
    matlab script Check_pop_to_dart.m. At present, I think matlab
    unwraps the N-D variables in opposite order to the way they are
    handled in the Fortran code.
    
    The model_mod:static_init_model() routine checks out, but the
    stubs for orthogonality are just that - stubs.
    
    The communication of how often it is possible to stop the model
    and when to generate the restart file is not finished.

    This provides support for CODAR observations. This has not been
    extensively tested as we have no actual CODAR observations. Ibrahim
    is expected to test this and report back. The CODAR observation file
    is supposed to have the following 12 columns:
    LAT LON DEPTH ANGLE OBS_value Z_LOC ERR_obs QC_flag TYPE_obs STARTDATE1 STARTDATE2 CODAR_ID
    
    The ANGLE and CODAR_ID make it different from the other observation types
    supported by the create_ocean_obs.f90 program. In order to accomodate that,
    a new namelist variable has been added to create_ocean_obs_nml.

    The default is to use the real observation times, which was the previous

    New routine for opening a text file and returning each line, one at a time.
    Currently used for programs which operate on a list of files, but could
    be generally useful.  also some minor touchups on calls to the error handler
    where they were missing the context args in the error cases.  this does not
    have the fix to the open_file routine; it needs more testing.

    Update from Ryan; have the interpolation routine use the same code
    for PRESSURE and SURFACE_PRESSURE as other fields do; interpolate in
    the surface field if the vertical type is surface, otherwise interpolate
    in the full 3d field. (it makes the surface pressure kind unnecessary.)
    Also more fine-tuning on the allowed-kinds test; density can be
    interpolated if geo. height and pressure are present, trap if
    an unknown kind is specified, and set surface pressure if PSFC is in the
    state list even if it is marked as type KIND_PRESSURE.

commit 9dfa5a7415e9d166a45ce7e47327c41766637976
Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Wed Jun 3 08:37:10 2009 -0600

    Added one additional option to the timestamp routine - if position
    is 'brief', the time will be printed on a single line instead of in a
    block format.  if specified, 'string1' will be printed as a label.
    should make it simpler to use things like grep to extract timestamps.

    adding the 'action=write' argument causes this to fail at open()
    time if the current dir is not writable, so we can print out a better

    Same functionality as before, but added better error checks

    not supported with the contents of the state vector.  (now that
    the state vector contents are namelist driven and completely
    flexible, it is much easier to get into this situation.)

    The second graphic of bad observation locations is only generated

    to read a netcdf observation sequence. The limits on the colorbars

    I'd overlooked adding:  default_state_variables = .true.
    to the input.nml. since it defaults to true, unless you add it and
    set it to false, the state vector will always be the minimal 6 arrays
    no matter what's listed in the namelist.  Also added more prints in
    the model_mod saying if it's using the defaults, and in any case,
    print out exactly which arrays are being added to the state vector
    for each domain.

    Fixed the interface for the acars rel hum in the ecmwf, and then did a bit of
    getting the files into sync - white space, comments, etc -- nothing functional
    but should make diffing the files easier to spot actual differences in values.

    Most pervasive change - the namelist echo will only be to the .nml
    file by default, not to the standard output.  this should make it easier to
    see actual messages in the output.  Programs which call the restart
    write routines without calling the static_assim_model_init code first will
    have it called for them, which means it will read the namelist and honor
    the settings of binary or ascii for the file formats.  quickbuild.csh scripts
    will by default clean up when they are done, removing .o, .mod, and the
    input.nml.*_default files.  (comment the rm lines out if you want to keep them.)
    merge_obs_sequence is removed; has been supplanted by obs_sequence_tool for
    quite a while now.   updates to the wrf model_mod to fix performance and mysterious
    errors if no 'namelist.input' file was found (it is unused by the model_mod,
    but is stored in the output diag files if present).  updated version of am2 model_mod.

    This script performs the correlation of one variable at a particular
    lat/lon/level and correlates it against another variable at a
    particular level -- all lat/lons. At present, this uses a DART Prior/Posterior
    file with all the ensmble member copies in it. Kevin ripped out the
    prior/posterior means and spreads,etc -- so this script just gets all
    the copy indices available; which is probably not smart.

    Make the string lengths for netcdf variable names NF90_MAX_NAME long.
    In at least one case, adding on the _d01 suffix to the name made the
    string longer than the declared length (which was short -- something
    like only 10 chars).  In an unrelated stab at code cleanup, took all
    the local subroutine errstring variables and made a single, module-wide
    copy, to reduce (slightly) the stack space requirements, removed
    a couple unused variables, and turned one debug flag off that was
    unintentionally left on.  Also made intent(in) strings declared (len=*)
    so the caller isn't forced to pad constant strings to some fixed length.

    so it's possible to find out (easily) what the total size of all the
    specified fields are for each nested domain.  This has no external footprint
    outside the model_mod.

    Renamed obs_to_table  to wind_obs_to_table because it only does paired wind
    observations ... not all the scalar observations.
    
    First commit of the much ballyhooed "observation sequence to netcdf" converter -
    named ... obs_seq_to_netcdf ... at the moment, the mkmf_ and path_names_ files
    are in an uncommitted but much needed   observations/utilities/threed_sphere
    directory. When more platforms are tested, the mkmf_ and path_names_ files
    will populate the required places. I'll add the documentation at that time.

    This split off from the original advance_model.csh script before I had
    added the 'really halt on failure' section to the script.  Move it over
    so this one behaves the same way.  It is *not* ok for any of the wrf
    model advances to fail.

    This change supports the creation of ASCII files (and supporting plotting
    routines) of the wind observations in any observation sequence file - before or
    after assimilation. If before assimilation, the 'original' QC values are
    maintained - if after assimilation the DART QC values are used.
    With plot_wind_vectors.m, it is possible to color-code the wind observations
    based on their assimilation status.
    
    plot_wind_vectors.m ... needs to have a longitude-wrapping subsetting
    utilities_mod.f90 ... uses module-scoped msgstring instead of many
    utilities_mod  ... added routine 'next_file()', uses module-scoped msgstring

    The schedule_mod module is intended to declare the temporal schedule for an
    assimilation experiment. There is a namelist that not only sets the calendar
    but also sets the first&last bin edges and some stride which is currently NOT
    slaved to any model timestep (WHICH IT SHOULD). Anyway, it works for obs_to_table,
    and is a logical start to a namelist-controlled experiment instead of one driven
    by the observation sequence files.

    sidd (ncar consulting) says the loader flags we used to have here
    (-bmaxdata:2000000000 and -bmaxstack:2000000000) were good for the 32-bit
    version of the compiler, to use more memory.  BUT, for the 64-bit version
    it was actually restricting the max memory for the job.  so they're gone.
    (and interestingly, compiling filter like that and then starting another
    job in async=2 mode restricted the subjob as well, no matter how it was
    compiled -- inheriting limits in the proc table at exec time?)  anyway,
    we removed them and should be able to run larger jobs on ibm platforms now.

    First of several expected major updates to the WRF model_mod and
    related programs. THIS UPDATE IS NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE THE OUTPUT
    compared to previous runs.  It rearranges the initialization code,
    makes the field selection namelist driven, and moves the bulk of
    the functions in the old dart_tf_wrf program back into the model_mod
    where it should be easier to maintain.
    
    The dart state vector contents are completely namelist driven now;
    the wrf field names, and order they are copied into the state vector,
    are based on the values in the 'wrf_state_variables' namelist item.
    The updated input.nml contains a namelist which is consistent with
    previous model_mod defaults; if no namelist is specified, the dart
    state vector will consist of:  U, V, W, T, QVAPOR, PH, MU.
    
    dart_tf_wrf was split into two programs: dart_to_wrf and wrf_to_dart.
    If 'wrf_state_bounds' is specified in the model_nml namelist, the
    values will be clamped within the given range.  NULL means infinity.
    the programs can also error out if a value is outside a valid range.
    
    The advance_model.csh script was updated to call dart_to_wrf and
    wrf_to_dart instead of dart_tf_wrf.  The older mkmf and path_names
    files were removed and new ones added for the new converters.
    
    Thanks to Josh Hacker for doing the code for this update.

    Minore update to ensure that if advance_state() is called when
    a model advance is NOT needed, that it will return cleanly.
    Most code calls move_ahead() first, which will say whether an
    advance is needed, and then the code simply does not call
    advance_state().  But there is nothing to prevent advance_state()
    from being called independently and it should have some bullet
    proofing for incorrect time cases.

    Fixed errors in the obs_sequence_tool, the ncep observation
    converters, and obs_diag when restricting locations to a
    particular bounding box.  The case was unlikely (a box which
    started west of 0 and crossed east past 180) but the previous
    code would have done an incorrect selection of locations.
    
    A single common routine was added to the utilities module which
    handles the wrap across longitude 0 consistently, and code in the
    locations mod now calls it.  Other converters and code which
    deal with longitude wrap have been updated to use either the
    utilities routine (which deals with simple values) or the

    This change largely tracks Balaji's version for FMS
    mkmf,v 14.0 2007/03/20 22:13:27 fms
    It retains our auto-namelist generation and flag for MPIFC, MPILD, etc.
    I changed the block so it does not pass the "-l opts" to the compiler,
    they get passed just to the loader (where the libraries need to be ...)
    This was necessary for the mods to support the library-specific options
    that are containted in the mkmf_xxxxx files instead of the mkmf.template
    that would be used for every compile. i.e. quikscat/work/mkmf_convert_L2b

    This version has the correct formula for converting the mission
    specs into U,V variances, and will compile (and link!) with the
    Intel compiler. There are still some games being played with the F77 code,
    and I cannot get the 'product' check to work yet. Converts one orbit
    (100 minutes) into a 12MB file (binary). Also has region subsetting.

    Adding the first cut at U,V support of JPL hdf-format QuikSCAT winds.
    So far, just choosing the highest-ranked ambiguity with 'perfect' qc flag.
    The variance calculation is ABSOLUTELY wrong ... will fix tomorrow.
    Really should introduce types of speed, dir instead of U,V components.
    Models will have to have a (trivial) forward operator ... better.
    The original JPL F77 routines are also included for comparison.

    Update to make smoother work correctly.  All files in this commit batch
    will need to be updated together in order to build, as the move_ahead()
    function has been split into 2 parts to accomodate the need for
    updating at the proper time when smoothing.
    
    Also added better tracing facility to filter - set trace_execution to true
    in the &filter_nml in input.nml to get detailed information about what part
    of the cycle is being executed.  You will also get more details about what
    the data time is and what the model advance time should be.
    
    Updated namelists and html to match current code.
    
    Smoother fixed to use proper states in circular buffer, to not overwrite
    times with incorrect values, to handle runs where the first action is
    assimilation and not a model advance, and to not advance when the main
    execution loop is being exited because all obs have been assimilated.

Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Tue Mar 31 11:39:38 2009 -0600

    In obs_sequence_mod, 2 important fixes.  First, in the interactive create
    routine, test the time of the next observation and only use the faster
    insert subroutine when the time is later than the previous obs.  The old
    code allowed obs to be inserted in the wrong time order and no errors were
    detected.  It resulted in obs files which ran through filter without complaint,
    but some obs could be assimilated in the wrong time window.   Second, add
    error checking code in the insert subroutine; if the optional third argument
    is given to insert, test the time and ensure it is valid relative to the
    given insert point, before doing the forward search.  Otherwise, error out.
    
    In obs_sequence_tool, add a time validation routine.  It traces the linked
    list and errors out on any observations which are not monotonically increasing
    in time.  This should help catch any files which were created with the
    interactive routine and where the obs were not in time order.

    This has better range-finding capability for small ( < 1.0 ) quantities.

    Use the error handler (instead of print) to output the 'doing n of m'
    message so it goes both into the log and stdout; print a message at
    the end of the entire assim cycle so it's clear that the end was reached

    repeatedly call the plot_wind_vectors function ... with a pause

    since the kinds table is also hardcoded in this version of the files.

    Add more detailed print messages about what the current assimilation
    window is, what is the time of the data both before and after the model
    advance, whether the model is advancing first or assimilating first.
    Seems to be very helpful for users with the larger models. If you want
    to revert to the original move_ahead messages, go into the code and
    set 'print_time_details' to false and you will see almost exactly
    what was there before.

    No change to actual executable code; simply adding a commented out block
    for debugging -- prints out the filename of the restart file before the
    call to open.  some fortran runtime systems trap the open and it can be
    difficult to see what file is causing problems.  comment in the timestamp
    line to have task 0 print out what restart file it is opening.  comment
    in the entire block to get every task to print out the filename.

    Fix an important error in the order that the lags are written
    out to the diag and restart files.  They were mislabeled and
    therefore out of time order.  Also allow a restart when Nlags
    is more than the number of assimilation cycles executed so far.
    And finally, add a message to the log as each assim lag is computed.

    Make public the routine which changes a generic kind string into
    an index number (the corresponding routine for specific types has
    existed for a long time; but there was nothing for the kinds).
    This is needed by josh for the wrf model_mod revisions.  The
    original routines were contributed by tim whitcomb who also
    needed them for the COAMPS model.
    
    Also, a group of changes which are internal to the code and
    *not* externally visible: renaming, where possible, 'kind' into
    'generic' and 'type' into 'specific', to start to try to ease
    the eventual transition from 'kind' in the public routine names
    and arguments into 'type'.  Right now most of the public usage
    is incorrect, which contributes to the confusion about which
    is which.  This requires a one line change to the preprocess
    program to rename an automatically built table.

    Non-backwards-compatible update.  The TSK (2d skin temperature)
    variable is now NOT present in the default set of state vars, but
    is only included if soil_data is .true. in the wrf model_mod namelist.
    Even if soil_data is true, the location of the TSK field has moved,
    so all restart and initial condition files need to be regenerated.
    This addresses problems with impacting the TSK field without updating
    any of the other soil variables; it lead to bad results in the WRF runs.

    Make the code use the generic functions for cos/sin/sqrt, not the
    specific dcos/dsin/dsqrt.  if you have r8==r4, this file will not
    compile, and if you are really using r8 reals, it will do the double
    precision calls correctly.

    Added note in code about the failure on the Absoft 9.0 compiler
    on a PowerPC based Mac.  Some binary files are misidentified
    by the open_restart_read() routine as ascii, which subsequently fails.
    Workaround is to use ascii for all restart files, and if necessary,
    go into obs_model_mod.f90 and change hardcoded string from
    'formatted' to 'unformatted' for the model advance files which
    are normally binary without namelist control.  This might also
    involve changing the same string in interpolate_model.f90 and
    any dart_sv_to_pv programs if model advance mode is not async 0.

    Last commit tried to use unallocated pointers instead of explicitly
    allocated arrays of size 0, which caused problems. Put back the
    original code for the sequence init and the obs init code to allocate
    even 0 size arrays.   Also remove a couple of unused local variables
    to avoid compiler warnings; there are still 2 pairs of warnings that
    aren't easily removed -- one is in code which will be enabled soon,
    the other is a pair of input args which are apparently no longer used
    but can't be changed without breaking the interface.

    Major change in this commit is the addition of an observations directory.
    Eventually all the programs which convert observations of various types
    into DART obs_seq files will be under this directory. For starters, there
    are 3: GPS, Radar, and MADIS converters.  Each has documentation.
    
    Also, committing the obs_sequence_tool which is the successor to the
    merge_sequence utility.  It has a lot more options; see the docs.
    Rename restart_file_utility to restart_file_tool to be consistent.
    
    Minor update to the intel mac template file.
    
    Updates to the obs_sequence_mod required by the obs_sequence_tool;
    mostly additional functions, but also removed the fixed 129 char
    length specification on many of the incoming args to the subroutines
    here.  No need to force the length; makes it easier on the callers.
    Also removed unused constants from the types_mod use statement.

    updated one more time for that troublemaker, query_location().
    the pgi 6.1.x compiler (but not 6.0.x or 7.0.x) gave a fatal
    error on 'selectcase(adjustl(attr))'.  removing the adjustl()
    call made it happy.  but i also removed the result() construct,
    and rearranged the code to simplify it even more in the hopes
    that i'll avoid future compiler issues.

    Using the utilities_mod:nc_check() routine to provide
    more insightful error checking for the netcdf routines. There
    are only three routines that were changed: static_init_model(),
    nc_write_model_atts(), and nc_write_model_vars() - BUT there
    were hundreds of changes. David Dowell used this to run his test
    case, and it bit-reproduced. I still want to revisit the netcdf
    output routines to ensure they are CF-compliant.

    Major update to the radar observation module, along with matching documentation
    and minor updates to the obs_kind and wrf model_mod files.  The following
    differences are not backward compatible:
    
    - the wrf model_mod used to stop if model_interpolate() was called with an
    unknown kind.  it now sets an error istatus code and returns.
    
    - the radar namelist has changed significantly.  see the documentation html
    file for details of the new namelist values.
    
    - the interactive create routines now take an azimuth and elevation for the
    radar beam and then do the trig to store 3 values in the file.  older versions
    of this code required the user to do the math themselves.
    
    - some constants which depend on the particular microphysics scheme being
    used have changed.  the defaults match the default microphysics scheme in
    wrf, but users should verify the values are what they expect.

    Adjust the query_location() code slightly to avoid a 16-byte character local
    variable.  On the Mac OSX 10.x fortran compiler, this resulted in a small
    memory leak but since this routine is called for every item in the state
    vector in several models, this added up.  The apparent solution is to remove
    the local variable and simply hard code in the default behavior instead of
    supplying a default string for the case statement.

    From Kevin:
       Replaces mean2cam_init.csh, and adds ensemble averaging of all of the
       non-state fields at each of the analysis times.  That includes the
       CLM ensemble, which requires recalculation of the snow level fields.
       That is accomplished via the NCO script snow.nco, which is embedded
       within analyses2initial.csh.
       The ensembles found in directories obs_####/Hhh, hh= the hour of the
       analysis.

Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>
Date:   Fri Nov 7 16:19:55 2008 -0700

    From Kevin:
       Updated to handle the ensembles of files in new directories Hhh (hh=
       the hour of the analysis), which store the non-state fields until
       analyses2initial.csh performs the ensemble averaging and inserts the
       analyses from Posterior_diag.nc into the averaged files.  The Hhh
       directories live in CENTRAL during the assimilation, and are moved
       to Exp/obs_#### after each obs_seq step is done.  The actual
       c[al]minput.nc files live in these Hhh directories, and links to
       them are made in the CENTRAL directory so that filter will find them.
       After analyses2initial.csh archives the analyses, Hhh are removed.

    Added the model_nml parameters for assimilation_period
    and modified trans_sv_pv to create a new data:PARM03 namelist with
    the proper model endtime. This provides the ability to assimilate
    unevenly-spaced observations ... and accurately advances the model
    to the 'advance_to_time' instead of a fixed amount specified by PARM03:endTime.

    Fixed logic that was causing Stripes to bomb with an even number of levels,
    now using the native netcdf f{} operator to extract levels and other coordinate
    variable information. For some reason getnc() was not reading the correct value
    for the WRF-MARS pressure levels even though the netcdf file was perfect. I have
    not determined why getnc() thought the highest pressure level was out-of-range
    and replaced it with NaN ...
    
    The problem with f{,1}(:) is that it does not replace missing values with NaN,
    so it is not a perfect replacement for getnc() ... which does the replacement.

    Updates - for nonlocal operator, match the algorithm used in generating
    the obs_seq files: once the height is above the cutoff, quit.  old algorithm
    went one more step past.  also pass back different (but positive) istatus
    values in cases of error, to help distinguish why things failed.  There is
    no change in the local operator code.  This version has a namelist in it
    but still commented out.  comment it back in to use it.

    Added support for platform-specific observations.
    This results in a change in the expected input file format for the raw observations.
    Previously, the observation type was a hard-coded integer, now it MUST be a STRING
    that matches one of the types defined in DART/obs_def/obs_def_MITgcm_ocean_mod.f90
    create_ocean_obs was tested with the PG compiler on Atlas and Intel on coral.
    The output filename is now a namelist variable.
    Removed baggage from original source that is not needed for this model.

    Interface between COAMPS and DART.  Contributed by Tim Whitcomb of the
    Naval Research Lab, Monterey.  COAMPS is the: Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere
    Mesoscale Prediction System and is trademarked by the Naval Research Lab.
    
    To use this model, you must go to the COAMPS web site and download the
    COAMPS model, and then go into the shell_scripts directory and run
    the initialize_dart.sh script to set up the necessary files before trying
    to build the programs in the work directory.

    The script is written in tcsh, but there is one step that gets evaluated
    with the user's default shell (sigh). Since there had to be a runme_filter.ksh,
    seemed appropriate to rename this to runme_filter.csh and then, depending

    Given a directory with N snapshot files and a DART input.nml file,
    MakeInitialEnsemble.csh will generate one whopping filter_ics file with
    N ensemble members in it. Under the default setting, the file will be
    a binary restart file. The inputs/data namelist is configured to generate
    a snapshot file every 12 hours for 20 days ... generating 41 snapshots
    (since you get one at T = 0 by default).
    
    Each snapshot file is converted to DART format by trans_pv_sv and the time tag
    is rewritten by the DART restart_file_utility. There is no guarantee that the
    initial ensemble will have anywhere near enough spread.

    Updated gps observation module.  The forward operator should be identical to
    previous versions.  Differences include:
    
     - most importantly, the error checking was corrected and tightened
     - added interactive routine to create gps obs from standard input
     - changed local variable 'key' to 'gpskey' to avoid confusion between
         gps-specific obs_def keys and the general observation key
     - made the private gps metadata space allocated at run time, and made it
         into a single derived type instead of separate unrelated arrays
     - added the option to have a run-time namelist to set the max gps obs
         allowed.  this is currently commented out in the code, but search for
         'NAMELIST' in 2 places and comment it back in to allow the limit to be
         set at run-time in the input.nml file
     - cosmetic changes, including shortening some separator lines and wrapping
         others to avoid lines larger than 80 columns

    Update from Kevin Raeder:
    Added obs_seq_freq to handle obs_seq.final files that are not daily,
    and added error detection for existence of the first obs_seq.final file.

    This is the first 'working' copy of MakeInitialEnsemble.csh
    It should be run in an empty directory.
    There are a couple lines at the beginning of the script that must
    be manually edited to point to the required input directories/files.
    It uses trans_pv_sv and restart_file_utility to hammer the time tags
    in each of the restart files. It reads a collection of snapshot files
    and converts each in turn, and then slams them all together.
    Did I mention it should be run in an empty directory? Really.

    Updates from Ryan Torn.  Perturb and update routines no longer depend
    on a namelist setting of the number of microphysics variables, which is
    not guarenteed to uniquely define which fields are in the restart files.
    Read the fields from the netcdf files and convert them all.  Also added
    an additional utility routine in netcdf cover functions module.

    Fix the dates on the daily files so they are compatible with the current
    create_real_obs program; that the 6 hr file centered at midnight is marked
    0124 for midnight between day 1 and 2, and not 0200 as you might expect.
    I still think observations exactly on 3Z,9Z,15Z and 21Z are not being binned
    into the right files in the non-daily case, and the windows should be
    namelist settable - but for now this is less incorrect.

    Added support for variables with UNDEFINED vertical levels.
    They are now treated as a 'one-level' variable - meaning they
    are all glommed together. The matlab scripts also support UNDEFINED.
    
    And, Just For Nancy, I fixed the logic of the program so that now
    if you have JUST ONE observation sequence file in another directory,
    obs_diag will process it and terminate normally rather than die if
    the directory node does not have an 'obvious' way to increment it.
    i.e.:
       obs_sequence_name = '/Users/thoar/temp/obs_seq.final',
    works.

    Fix 'use kinds' loop to run only up to the actual number of different kind strings;
    the previous code was replicating the use statements for the kinds, one per type.
    While apparently the compilers don't complain about replicated 'use, only' lines
    for the same symbol, it was certainly untidy.

    Remove the CAM 3.1 directory and include 2 .tar files:

    one which has modifications for CAM version 3.5.06.
    These are modified CAM source files that must be copied
    to the CAM build directory and incorporated into the
    CAM executables, not the DART ones.  See Kevin for more info.

    New scripts and revised scripts for archiving data to the mass store (ms).
    The old 'diag*' scripts are superceded by new code in auto_diag2ms_LSF.csh,
    same for auto_re2ms.csh and auto_re2ms_LSF.csh.  Details follow:
    
    auto_re2ms_LSF.csh
       Absorbed old auto_re2ms.csh into it to reduce number of scripts.
    
    auto_diag2ms_LSF.csh
       Calls mean2cam_init.csh which uses NetCDF operators (NCO) to extract Posterior means
          into CAM initial files.  Bundles those together with corresponding CLM state files
          (first ensemble member arbitrarily chosen, since mean of the CLM file is not
           available, or feasible)
    
    mean2cam_init.csh
       New script.
       Uses NetCDF operators to extract the mean state from Posterior_Diag.nc
       (the "analysis") and insert it into the corresponding CAM initial file.
       These are used to start CAM forecasts from DART-CAM analyses.
       Yes, it has to be as complicated as it is because of NCO features and limitations.
    
    obs_seq2ms.csh
       New script to archive month(s) of obs_seq.finals to the mass store.

    Many updates to the main job script from kevin:
       Change obs_seq output subdirectory names to 'obs_####' for more honest description
          of what they hold.
       New organization of archiving scripts, with error checking (auto_diag2ms_LSF.csh,
          auto_re2ms_LSF.csh).
       Save CLM and CAM  restart/initial files from intermediate forecasts (e.g. hours
          6,12,18, 24) for use in analysis archiving for CAM diagnostic forecasting.
      "run-job.log" is used by both job_mpi.csh and the scripts it creates:
          output from obs_seq scripts is now labelled as such within run-job.log
       Implemented partial fix to assims filling up /ptmp space; max_pend_archive
          sets limit to how many archive jobs (auto_diag2ms and auto_re2ms) can be
          pending in the queue and still allow the next obs_seq.out assim to proceed.
       Activated leap year code.
       Clarification comments.
       Implemented LSB_PJL_TASK_GEOMETRY to all async = 2 (non-MPI CAM) to fit on nodes
          with too little memory to run as many CAMs as there are processors.
       Added ability to exclude (a) node(s) from use by the job scripts using.
       Error checking of existence of c[al]minput.nc before linking to them.
       Make assim output on the local machine/directory be writable by a group of users.
       Use CLM restart file instead of initial file (restart_option = 'end' doesn't work
          with the gregorian calendar).  run-cam.csh has been modified accordingly.
             restart_option = 'nsteps'
             restart_n      = 12
          A test for this has been added to job_mpi.csh.

Author: Tim Hoar <thoar@ucar.edu>
Date:   Tue Jul 1 17:43:29 2008 -0600

    Simply making the subversion properties consistent and appropriate.
    /fs/image/home/thoar/scripts/SetSVNproperties.csh   exhaustively
    cruises through the entire DART tree and tries to 'do the right thing'.
    /fs/image/home/thoar/.subversion/config  _almost_  matches
    'the right thing'. Still don't know what to do with tags from other
    sources that we don't want to modify.

    Initial version of improved boxcar filter. Works as
    filter_kind 8. adaptive_inflate_mod.f90 was changed
    to make the routine solve_quadratic public. assim_tools_mod.f90
    added the logic to select filter_kind 8 and the code that
    implements it. This code is still under development.

    Corrects a serious bug in the 03Z version; restores code that adds 24 hours to
    the time, to ensure the observations processed by that version will be coded as
    being the next day.  This afffects anyone generating daily files using the
    prepbufr.csh script, and has been broken from revision 3138 on nov 6, 2007,
    to now (revision 3425, jun 11, 2008).

    The model mod NO LONGER requires a wrf namelist file.  It was only reading the
    timestep from the namelist, which it was also reading from the wrf input
    netcdf file.  So now it only reads the timestep from the netcdf file.

    Most important file change is the prepbufr input.nml; it now matches
    the NCEP obs types which are assimilated.  The create_real_obs.nml now
    matches the default values in the code.  Minor fix to the path_names
    file for create_real_obs to remove redundant obs_def modules.  The
    two prepbufr source files were made more consistent with each other,
    comments added, extra debug lines added, but no functional change.

Author: Nancy Collins <nancy@ucar.edu>

    Major commit of a variety of updates.   The details are spelled out
    in the top level README file, and pointers to the major changes
    are listed on the main DART html page.  The brief version is:
    
    1. The preprocess program for generating observation specific files has
    been improved and simplified.  See the README, and the html files in the
    obs_def and obs_kind directories for more details.  It should be simpler
    to define new obs_types, and you no longer need to edit path_names files
    as you add or delete obs types.
    
    2. Observation sequence files now write out a table of contents for only
    the observation types which occur in that file, and set 'max_obs' to the
    actual number of observations in the file.
    
    3. The MPI parallel version of filter should now kill other tasks if one
    exits.  This may mean adding null_mpi_utilities_mod.f90 to any private
    path_names files you have; all the ones in the repository have been updated.
    
    4. The mpi_utilities modules should now compile on all systems as they are
    distributed, without editing, except for users of the gfortran compiler.
    There is a shell program 'fixsystem' to edit the files for gfortran use.
    
    5. All model work directories now have a 'quickbuild.csh' script which
    recompiles all executables in that directory.  The 'workshop_setup.csh'
    scripts have been removed from the models which are not used by the
    tutorial workshop.  In the future they may become more customized for the
    tutorials, and so for general use the quickbuild script is recommended.
    
    6. Some of the large model directories now have a 'full_experiment'
    directory where the more complicated scripts are placed for multi-day
    filter advances.  The single filter run scripts remain in the previous
    'shell_scripts' directory for each model.
    
    7. The restart_file_utility now prints out times in both gregorian day count
    format and the more recognizable Y/M/D format.
    
    8. We have made an attempt to minimize the amount of spurious output that
    goes into the dart_log.out file, so it is easier to see real error messages
    and important status information.  Namelist output defaults to a file
    'dart_log.nml' and you can turn off the module registration messages via
    the utilities_nml namelist.  The location box statistics default to off.
    
    9. The names of the state vector files for model advances now match the
    convention for restart files when there is more than one file.
    This change should be invisible to users, and increases the usefulness
    of the restart_file_utility program.
    
    10. The test_dart.csh script has been updated.  If the MPI shell environment
    variable is defined, the bgrid_solo model will be compiled with MPI.

    Updated copy of the AM2 model_mod; one additional code section from the
    latest am2 version for 2d fields.  also, lines longer than 132 were split
    (several compilers have a hard linelength limit), and real tab characters
    were replaced with spaces (some older compilers do not like tabs for
    whitespace; it can also misalign text if looking at the source with
    terminals that use different default tab widths (e.g. 4 vs 8)).

    Setting item_size_direct_read to '4' (meaning bytes/record) which is pretty standard.
    The intel compiler needs to have a compile flag (-assume bytereclen) , but
    absoft, gfortran, aix (blueice), and pg all use 'bytes/record' as their default.

    Allow observations with an undefined vertical coordinate to be
    assimilated (can be a choice for vortex location obs).  Also,
    only allocate vertical height and pressure profile arrays in
    the vert_interpolate routine inside the code sections that
    are actually going to use them.  Avoids unneeded allocate()s,
    and makes returning early from the routine less likely to leave
    memory leaks.

    Add a new namelist item 'inf_damping' which allows you to
    damp the inflation values for either prior, posterior, or both.
    Values should be between 0.0 (no change to inflation as computed)
    and 1.0 (all inflation damped out).  Added code to filter.f90,
    docs to filter.html, defaults to filter.nml, and added the new
    values to all the default input.nml files.  filter.dopplerfold.f90
    also has a couple minor updates that were added to filter last week
    (i.e. deleting the sequence right before exiting) but not copied over
    until now.

    The trans_pv_sv program takes snapshot files [S,T,U,V,SSH]."timestepcount".[data,meta]
    and creates the 'assim_model_state_ud' file appropriate to be fed to DART.
    The time tag IN the file is derived from the middle portion of the snapshot filename
    and knowledge of the model deltaTmom, startDate_1, startDate_2 namelist values.
    The "timestepcount" is user input (read from stdin).
    
    The trans_sv_pv program takes DART-produced 'assim_model_state_ic' files
    that have both the valid time and the target (advance_to_) time and produces:
      S.yyyymndd.hhmmss.[data,meta]
      T.yyyymndd.hhmmss.[data,meta]
      U.yyyymndd.hhmmss.[data,meta]
      V.yyyymndd.hhmmss.[data,meta]
    SSH.yyyymndd.hhmmss.[data,meta] files as well as a new 'data.cal.new'
    namelist file with the updated startDate_1 and startDate_2 values. There
    is still work to be done to update the PARM03 namelist variable 'endTime'
    with the value written to stdout, and how we update the PARM05 namelist
    with the values of the new initial files.

    The second record has a whopping long array of r8-type reals.

    ReadObsSeq should now correctly identify ascii vs. binary observation sequence
    files. Ancient observation sequence files (those without the obs_kind_definitons
    table introduced with the 'I' release) are no longer directly supported.
    There are no guarantees this routine will read all observation types correctly.
    If there are metadata unique to the observation type, it will need to be manually
    supported since the matlab routines are unfortunately completely disjoint from
    the fortran routines.

    rdslice.m, wrslice.m, and rdmds.m are 'origina' routines from Ibrahim.
    xc = rdmds('XC');  for example.
    CheckMask.m and VerifyNetCDF.m are mine to ensure the netCDF files
    (and all the intermediate DART routines) are reading the state correctly.

    vector_to_prog_var rewritten to accomodate individual variable extraction.
    This should result in a smaller memory footprint. Also used automatic arrays
    instead of allocatable wherever the mood struck me. Compiles with absoft in
    addition to ifort. The grid variables (XG,XC,YC,YG,ZC,ZG) are believed to be
    correct.

    Fixed several syntax things that the ibm xlf compiler would not take
    (that ifort ignored); fixed the get_meta_data routine to not try to
    write into an optional arg which is not present, and finally have to
    read a different record length on ibm vs ifort -- still unresolved.
    for now there is a parameter at the top of the file which is going
    to have to be edited going between systems, but maybe we can figure
    out a way to automate even this.

    Used better figure orientations for a given number of regions.
    Using better precision for tick label annotation.
    Using only one figure window for all the plotting.
    Removed the 'wysiwyg' aspect since we almost always run these in batch.

    Made it a WARNING to declare observations as both vertical and surface types.
    utilities_nml:TERMLEVEL = 2 (means die on errors only) default is currently 1

    as these are not universally well-defined. bug-fixed the temporal evolution
    of the horizontal wind bias field to match that of the vertical profile and
    ensured that the F-O convention was being followed for the horizontal wind field.

    obs_diag.f90 has been extended to be able to plot the observation locations
    for obs_seq.out files (sequences without quantities to be tracked by obs_diag).
    The matlab scripts now use the metadata in the netcdf file for the location
    plotting. The namelist files now reflect the fact that all levels are
    automatically plotted.
    The biggest change is that obs_diag.f90 has a consistent definition of
    horizontal wind velocity rmse ... the rmse of the VECTOR wind velocity.
    The versions <= r3091 used this as the definition of RMSE.
    The versions > r3091 but less than this one output the RMSE of the wind speed.
    The netCDF variable names have been changed to reflect 'velocity'.
    Also ... since the beginning of time, obs_diag.f90 has been rejecting
    observations exactly at the highest pressure level ... which has been 75.0 hPa.
    Turns out, there are a fair amount of obs AT that level. I changed the
    default behavior to reject observations strictly above the highest pressure level.
    The versions > 3091 also are more precise in the definition of 'closest'
    level in that r8 arithmetic is used. (whether or not this is more accurate ...)

    Add new namelist item:  allow_obs_below_vol, which defaults to .false.
    If an observation is below the surface height, it will always be rejected.
    If it is between the surface height and the lowest sigma level, it will
    by default be rejected (marked as missing); changing this new namelist
    item to .true. will allow that observation to be processed, and the
    forward operator value will be computed by extrapolating downward from
    sigma levels 1 and 2.
    
    Also includes a minor update to the geopotential height interpolation code:
    interpolate first and then divide by G (Ryan Torn).  Finally, the additional
    query routines added by Ryan Torn for use by external programs have been
    consolidated into a single query routine which returns all information
    available about the domain.

    same default behavior as before, but lots more detail at the top of the source file about the options and settings; added several compile-time options, e.g. set the R4/R8 real size with a single #define, handle files written by a DART compiled with the gfortran compiler (the binary files are not immediately compatible with other compilers) and allow the use of the converter on the same machine as the data was written before you move it to the other architecture

    Implemented a fix so that the xlf bounds checking works OK. Three other
    bounds checkers did not have a problem with the length of the return of
    the F90 intrinsic 'maxloc'. xlf NEEDED it to be an array(1) everyone else
    was happy to have it be array(same_shape_as_input). Took the opportunity
    to remove some clutter -- no other changes.

    levels. Only rejection criterion are the DART QC flags. Tracks number of obs used,

    plot_bias_xxx_profile - plots vertical profiles of 'bias' and one other quantity.
    plot_evolution - plots the temporal evolution of one quantity, all variables, all
    levels.
    plot_rmse_evolution - plots the evolution of root-mean-squared-error (rmse) and on
    additional quantity - all variables, all levels.
    
    The 'quantities' are those defined in the netcdf file CopyMetaData variable.

    use cam_phis for the height data, not topog_file.  topog_file data is inaccurate in that it does not match the heights used inside the model - especially bad if you use the eulerian core.  the cam_phis file should be generated from a previous cam run history file

    collection of changes to support reading either just the inflation mean or just
    the inflation standard deviation values from a restart file.  the file-by-file
    details follow.
    
    adaptive_inflate_mod.f90:
     separated out the reading of the inflation mean and standard deviation
     from a restart file.  one, both, or neither can now be specified separately
     for the prior and posterior inflation, with any of the inflation options.
     also added better error handling for inf_flavor 1 where it reads in the
     previous inflation values directly.
    
    filter.f90, filter.nml, filter.html:
     changed namelist; inf_start_from_restart is obsolete, replaced by two items:
     inf_initial_from_restart and inf_sd_initial_from_restart.  changed namelist
     and documentation to match.  changed call to adaptive_inflate_init() to match
     interface change.
    
    smoother_mod.f90:
     interface to adaptive_inflate_init changed slightly; changed the
     calling code to match.
    
    time_manager_mod.f90:
     added code to read()/write() to catch errors so we can generate a specific
     message instead of relying on the default fortran run-time error messages.
     added optional 4th arg to write_time to return write error code so calling
     code can generate an error message with more context.  also changed routine to
     try to inquire() for the filename on error. added the same inquire() code for
     read_time errors.
    
    models/*/work/input.nml:
     split the previous filter_nml entry: inf_start_from_restart into two, now
     inf_initial_from_restart and inf_sd_initial_from_restart.  (unrelated to
     the inflation changes, but also added namelist for restart_file_utility_nml
     where it was missing.)
    
    assim_model_mod.f90:
     in testing these changes, ran into cases where the iostat value was not being
     returned to the code; i was getting whatever run-time fortran error messages
     happened to be generated (sometimes helpful, sometimes not).  added iostat=
     to several open()/read()/write() calls, with error handling and calls to the
     dart error code with more context about the file and what we were trying to
     do. init_diag_output, aread_state_restart, and awrite_state_restart were all
     affected by this update.  also commented out 3 debugging messages.
    
    utilities_mod.f90:
     added code in the check_namelist_read section which, if the error is about
     the obsolete inf_start_from_restart item, prompts to both stdout and the log
     the new namelist items which replace it.  as part of this, also committed
     slight changes to the timestamp formatting routines so the times always line
     up in the same columns for both start and end.  (makes it easier to use 'cut'
     to compute time intervals). also added a (for now undocumented) namelist item
     'module_details' which defaults to .true., but if set .false. will turn off
     the module registration messages in the log file. we might want to have the
     modules log to a separate file to keep the dart_log cleaner (and easier to
     find/see real info messages).

    The bgrid model now uses the internal observation 'kinds' in set_def.out and
    obs_seq.in. This allows a more standard definition of 'surface' observations.
    Previous versions had a 'vloc' of 'level', but the actual level was -1 (historically
    used to indicate surface) Since there is now a 'vloc' specifically for surface,
    we are using it.

    do not require that this module (unlike the real mpi module) call the init routine before anything else.  if you try to use any of the other functions, it calls init at that time and carries on.  this makes it easier on some of the single-threaded applications which want to query number of tasks, etc.

    This patch addresses the use of 'surface' observations.
    For observation 'types' that are flagged as both 'surface' and 'pressure'/'height',
    it it intended that the surface observations are simply tossed in the lowest level.
    This will happen ONLY AFTER an observation of type 'pressure/height' is encountered
    for that observation 'type'. If you have 8000 dewpoint temperatures with the
    vertical location flagged as surface and then one with the vertical location flagged
    as 'pressure' ... the first 8000 will have been skipped by this point.
    I don't really know a way around that ...

Author: Tim Hoar <thoar@ucar.edu>
Date:   Fri Aug 24 16:42:01 2007 -0600

    This version contains a patch to clobber the DART QC value to '2' (reject posterior)
    if ANY of the observation copies contains a MISSING_R8 value.
    There is one pathological case that happened with WRF using dewpoint
    temperatures and radiosonde temperatures. Analysis showed that
    (in 4 cases out of 80,000) the QC flags were incorrect given that some or
    all of the the posterior values were flagged as missing. NONE of the
    priors had this problem. The functionality can be turned on or off by using
    the 'verbose' namelist variable. When the QC values are correct, this
    patch will be backed out.

Date:   Wed Aug 22 11:55:11 2007 -0600

    Made several changes to model_mod.f90. Largest footprint is that I removed
    the internal 'check' routine for the netCDF calls in favor of the generic
    utitlies_mod:nc_check(). The netCDF coordinate variables now have attributes for
    cartesian_axis, following the standard. There was also a variable called 'type'
    which is already reserved for an intrinsic routine name, so I changed it to
    'mytype' - which was unused. filter_restart files were (binary) identical
    before and after the changes. All that remains is to be more strict in the use
    of the r8 type ... complicated by the fact there are two additional modules.

Author: Tim Hoar <thoar@ucar.edu>
Date:   Tue Aug 21 20:36:12 2007 -0600

    Added the pe2lyr model support and implemented a routine to generate
    appropriate corner/endpnt arrays that are appropriate for all variable orderings
    IFF the netCDF variables have their coordinate variables appropriately defined
    (by being named the same as the dimension scalar and having a 'cartesian_axis'
    attribute  - if possible)

    made change to reflect fact the netcdf variable 'level' is now called 'lev' - so that it is now recognized as a coordinate variable.

    Added comments to highlight the fact the storage mode in the
    netcdf file is different from the norm. Most of the other 3D variables
    are stored time-copy-level-lat-lon
    rose is time-copy-lat-lon-level

    I only changed the netcdf output block.
    Renamed the coordinate variable to be the same as the dimension scalar.
    It used to come out  level(lev)  ... which meant it was not really a coordinate
    variable. It is now lev(lev). all the lat/lon/level coordinate variables have
    appropriate "cartesian_axis" attributes as well.

    the forward operator should return 0 for OK, and positive numbers for various (user specified) error codes; negative return values are only used internally and should never happen here.  add a call to the error handler to catch this case right here.

    revame CheckModelCompatibilty to add start/end time for truth & diagn file to bracket time overlaps, so data can have different sizes and the common range will be carried through, extracted, and plotted.  required minor changes to most of the matlab scripts; in most cases it was changing the code to augment an existing struct instead of constructing a new one each time.

    Including 'mean_source' and 'source_phase' to the state vector.
    Took them straight from Jeffs dart:/project/jeff/DART_J/DART/

    the first three state variables ... the ones in the 'assimilate_these_obs_types'
    namelist ... perhaps this is as it should be ...

    The absoft compiler found unused variables.
    If the variables were used in code that was commented out, the
    declaration was commented out. If the variables were simply not
    used, they were removed.

    Absoft found a lot of unused variables.
    If they were needed for lines that were commented out, I commented
    out the declaration. If they were not used at all, I removed them.

    Changed INTENT of interactive_rad_[ref,vel] solo argument to INOUT,
    as they are queried and modified by the routines. The absoft compiler complains
    about this. Furthermore, in the check to see if there is room ... the

    renamed .F to .F90 because .F extension usually/always causes compilers to assume f77 syntax which is wrong for these files. Changed path_names accordingly. Script shell_scripts/ChangeExtensions.csh goes back&forth ... with a little editing.

Author: Tim Hoar <thoar@ucar.edu>
Date:   Fri Mar 2 15:22:41 2007 -0700

    shell_scripts/job_mpi.csh (new file, successor to job.csh)
    Major rewrite:
    MPI; job_mpi.csh writes out a $exp_#.lsf script for each obs_seq.out file.
    Each script runs filter as an MPI batch job, executing advance_model.csh as needed.
    No filter_server.csh and filter.csh are needed.
    New adaptive inflation files; [prior,post]_inf_[ic,restart,diag]
    run-pc.csh is now retrieved from the DART directory tree by advance_model.csh.
    [cam,clm]input.nc files are stored and retrieved from the CAMsrc directory,
    rather than locally.
    Some new parameters in the "User set parameters" section.
    Some parameters moved out of "User set parameters".
    Added comments about "branching" an assimilation and starting without a model advance.
    Fixed automatic archiving of selected restart/IC data sets to the mass
    store (auto_re2ms_LSF.csh).
    Cleaned up handling of CAM namelistin file.
    Removed KILL_COMMAND from the sections that move c[al]miput_#.nc to the
    experiment directory storage.
    Minor code smoothing throughout.  (CVS 1.1)

    added better comments in the code; the rest of this log message applies to the
    previous revision: added an extra if(present()) test for an optional argument
    which the gfortran compiler was not correctly passing down to called subroutines
    in 2 places. if the compiler gets fixed, this extra code can be removed.(CVS 1.5)

    There were several bug fixes (version 1.54 was only tested for Eulerian CAM)
    resulting from:
    assimilating obs on heights;
    > order of dimensions of hybi
    > index into whole list of fields instead of a set of nD fields
    using the CAM FV core initial conditions files;
    > staggered grid interpolation error,
    > dealing with non-character attributes of coordinates on CAM initial files,
    > array subsection of fields written to CAM initial files (write_cam_init),
    > correct handling of latitudes outside of the array of
      staggered latitudes and mis-defined type for val_local (should be r8)
      (coord_index),
    > correct handling of negative longitudes found in the staggered
      longitude coordinate array (coord_val).

    Implemented the check of the dart qc flag in the GetRatio routine.
    Should be more robust if prior mean or prior spread is MISSING, however,
    how this would occur in the low-order models is a bit beyond me.
    Still -- good style.

    Added a table explaining DART qc values and meanings.
    Tweaked print statement for 'distant' observations.

    Changed interface type for ran1 (uniform) and gasdev (gaussian) to return type 'r8' to assuage fears of where the type conversion will happen. Seems robust in any event, so I don't think it will make any difference.

    physically delete broken nodes from the sequence when merging with an
    empty obs_seq.  The empty obs_seq has to have a header and first = last = -1
    It also needs to be the first obs_seq file to be merged.

    Initial attempt at supporting observations on model levels. Dies when using identity observations, they are indicated by having an obs_kind which is the negative of the state vector index ... which is being used as an array index somewhere. (not in obs_diag.f90)This indicates to me that a routine is being called that does not support identity obs ... but should?

    Now uses threed_sphere location module and new generic observation types. Compiles with Intel and Lahey if you throw the flags for promoting double precision and 'free-format'. Have not actually _run_ with those. Josh indicates it did run with the PG compiler.

    Still uses column location mod, but now uses the generic obs_kinds and a combination of vert_is_surface() calls. Replaced some calls to real() by using _r8. Still need to use the compiler autopromotion flags, I suspect. The moist variable interpolation still needs some work.

    obs_diag now reads the bin separation directly from the observation sequence file, so the namelist variable is removed. The iskip variable has been renamed to a more informative -- iskip_seconds -- the regions and their names are also variable now. The undesirable level variable has been removed.

    These routines use the metadata from ObsDiagAtts.m which is generated by
    running obs_diag.  The U,V wind components are converted to a scalar wind
    speed and summarized. This presents some complication since we are considering
    U,V independently for rejection testing, etc. The same matlab scripts work
    for both the threed_sphere/obs_diag.f90 and oned/obs_diag.f90 results.

    Removing this file. Since the diagnostics are primarily associated with
    either low-order models or high-order models, we are providing different
    programs to accomplish this. The distinction is one of 'location' types.
    CAM/WRF/bgrid_solo  should all use diagnostics/threed_sphere/obs_diag.f90
    from now on.

    Changed PROCNAMES from a string to a wordlist for CAM failure recovery.
    Changed from using a local work directory to a pre-defined remote (/ptmp).
    Removed removal of CLM pointer files because they are model specific.
    Installed code to rerun CAMs (and regions) that failed due to node/system problems.
    A second failure results in filter_server aborting the job.  This could be made
    more robust.  It could also be more concise by use of an additional script that
    queries for failures and reruns the CAMs or regions.

    Batch job to save restart datasets to the Mass Store from an LSF batch machine.
    It figures out how many ensemble members to bundle together for efficient transfer,
    then calls auto_re2ms.csh.  It's submitted by job_LSF_GPFS.csh as a separate batch job.

    New, for central CAM directory use.  No build of CAM if it doesn't exist.
    CAM is also run single-threaded (no MPI).

commit ca1f669a3ce53193172d2ba06d9fd269de336937
Author: Tim Hoar <thoar@ucar.edu>
Date:   Fri Sep 30 10:15:19 2005 -0600

    Renamed run-pc_local.csh to run-pc_mpi.csh to better reflect the difference
    between run-pc.csh (generic, simple CAM 'run' script) and this version.
    
    run-pc_mpi explicitly sets environment variables to be sure they're set on
    each processor (NFS) (for bangkok /scratch/local).  A single CAM is run on a
    node using both processors on that node. Also, this script is NOT for use with
    central CAM directory.
    
    This script will also attempt to build cam if the executable does not exist.
    Not for the faint of heart.

    Batch script to organize an experiment on a GPFS file system machine
    using LSF batch control.  Handles obs_seq.out files which have
    either 12 or 24 hours/file (or any other divisor of 24) Uses DART
    feature that first input.nml must specify the start day and time, but
    all subsequent obs_seq iterations can share a second input.nml, which
    has init_time_days < 0 and init_time_secs < 0. Uses a cam executable
    from a central CAM directory, instead of local to this experiment.
    Has code to replace the forecasts in the caminput_##.nc files with
    analyses from *_ud##.  Always compresses and archives restart files
    from the previous obs_seq.

    This is nearly identical to the ifort.ghotiol model, but the compiler on

    Use direct access to ensemble storage in cases where storage is in core
    for obs and state space diagnostics and covariance inflation. Modified
    order of output for state and obs space diag files so that mean comes
    first, then spread. Removed cutoff from namelist.

    Modified write on line 151 to write(seq_unit) ens to satisfy certain
    compilers. Don't output state when not requested in ens_ensemble_manager.
    Adjusted length of print formats for assim_model_state_ud from a21 to
    a20 to help Lahey compiler. Allow direct public acces to ens, ens_mean
    and ens_spread through public interface. Added interface is_ens_in_core
    to allow checking whether this is the case.

    Originally from CAM release, modified to run in DART environment:
       Takes CASE, MODEL, PBS_O_WORKDIR, machinefile as arguments.
       Builds a namelist based on namelistin, adding in start and stop times
          from file 'times'.
       Uses mpirun to run CAM on however many processors are in 'machinefile'.
       Has a lot of path names for mpirun to use; edit for each new machine.
       Moves CAM and CLM initial files back to workdir, and deletes the rest.
    Probably does not configure and compile CAM if an executable is not found.

    (sometimes) available processors; claim the nodes for filter_server.csh first
    because it uses all processors on them.  Then claim one processor of another
    node (which I can share) for filter.csh.

commit 15f3319bbd150c1f3ed58b682605791be2ebce6a
Author: Kevin Raeder <raeder@ucar.edu>
Date:   Wed Dec 22 22:18:10 2004 -0700

    This version is used with the async=3 (parallel model advances and assimilation
    of regions) in the Hawaii release.
    The main differences with the previous version are;
       - it no longer runs filter.  it runs advance_model.csh and assim_region.csh.
       - additional internal documentation
       - automatically figures out how many nodes and processors/node there are
       - submits model advances and region assimilations accordingly, including
         defining a machinefile for each, if necessary. A machinefile is a subgroup
         of processors to be used by particular ensemble member model advance.
       - has exponentially increasing waits, up to 8 seconds
       - checks for the existence of all the assim_model_state_ud files before
         continuing.
    This is a platform-specific script, with no reference to the forecast model.

Author: Kevin Raeder <raeder@ucar.edu>
Date:   Tue Dec 21 12:36:53 2004 -0700

       job.csh is a script to manage an assimilation experiment in the context of
    async = 3; running on a PC cluster.  It is a replacement for long_run.csh.
    It runs on the master node but runs the filter executable on a compute node,
    and runs the model advances and assimilation of regions on a separate
    set of compute nodes, so that the master node is not as much of a bottleneck.
    As many of the experiment-specific script variables as possible have been
    pulled into this script in order to make setup clearer.
    This script defines a directory organization for output, and expects
    a similar structure for experiment input.
    "chunks" (long_run.csh) are now referred to as obs_seq files.
    filter initial conditions can now be a single file, or a set of files
    corresponding to the ensemble members.
    
       See online documentation for a flowchart and instructions, and see the
    internal documentation in this script for details.

    Script to advance one ensemble member of CAM in the context of async = 3;

       > much more internal documentation,
       > incorporation of an (optional) 4th argument to allow transparent use of
         machines with >1 processor/node,
       > use of pathnames for caminput.nc and clminput.nc passed from job.csh via
         file 'casemodel', instead of hardwiring names in advance_model.csh
       > make removal of temp directory dependent on successful forecast.

    single_restart_file = .false.

Author: Kevin Raeder <raeder@ucar.edu>
Date:   Wed Dec 8 11:10:52 2004 -0700

    Completed implementation of accomodating CAMs 2 different coordinate orders
    ({read,write}_cam_init, coord_order).
    Inserted Jeff's version of pert_model_state (hard-wired TYPE_x) to do a better
    cold start in the T21x80 case.  (A more generic version is available in
    model_mod_gwd.f90, but it misuses interf_provided.)

Author: Kevin Raeder <raeder@ucar.edu>
Date:   Fri Nov 5 14:58:19 2004 -0700

    Changes to easily include model parameters in the state vector.
    This involves defining a new which_vert type because the parameters may have
    no vertical location.  which_vert can now be specified in model_nml for each
    model field in state_names_Xd.
    model_mod also handles model field TYPEs more generically now, with the
    hardwired connection to obs KINDs isolated into a new subroutine.
    get_val and get_state_meta_data were rewritten, but usage remains the same.

    Install temporary fix for getting PS in model_get_close_states
    when more than one region is used for assimilation.
    State vector augmented (partial implementation) to include 0D and 1D variables.
    The 1D opens the question of how to handle variables with varying 1D sizes;
    lat, height, other?
    DART in general can't handle surface obs yet.  Here PS (and Q) are excluded.
    get_closest_lat_index still relies on the spacing of the first 2 lats being
    the same as the spacing for all other adjacent pairs.

    Changed to single istatus integer variable. Passing model state to
    get_close. Added initial step towards WRF radar obs. Changed algorithm
    in move_ahead so that it now grabs all obs in centered window around
    models natural times (i.e. if model has 6h timestep, grabs obs from
    +/- 3 hour window around 00 GMT).

commit 6dbf9492142953558e6c7f19d3d69a705bb7c392
Author: Jeff Anderson <jla@ucar.edu>
Date:   Tue Dec 2 13:31:35 2003 -0700

    Implements a number of changes, both algorithmic and implementation.
    First, note that for single group filters (the default single ensemble
    that we've been using for a long time) these changes are believed to
    be bit reproducing if compile with ifc with optimization turned off
    -O0. The changes are known to be non-reproducing if optimization level
    2 -O2 is used, although results appear to be qualitatively unchanged for
    a variety of cases with L96 and the GFDL bgrid. WARNING: You should
    carefully check this update for your applications to make sure that it
    reproduces when you update.
    
    Impelementation updates include: changing from assim_model_type to
    allocated array storage for state and ensemble vectors with associated
    time types. Also, computations for the ensemble mean and spread have
    been rewritten slightly and no longer bit reproduce when optimized.
    
    Algorithmic changes. 1. covariance inflation is now done on each group
    separately. This has no impact when a single group is used.
    2. The localization factor is not passed to any update routines but
    just multiplies the regression confidence factor. Again, no impact
    if only using one group.
    3. Although commented out in the repository, the gross bias check
    methodology has been modified.

commit fea699ef2039c910cbd6f7e5728e4f52d4d95509
Author: Jeff Anderson <jla@ucar.edu>
Date:   Tue Dec 2 12:23:51 2003 -0700

    This comment really concerns the update made in the previous version
    but a commit error deleted this message:
    Functionally, this update is backward compatible. All original interfaces
    are still supported. However, all interfaces that took an assim_model_typ
    as an arguement and produced a change in the state or time of the
    assim_model_type have been duplicated with new interfaces that take a
    pair of separate arguments: a time_type(s) and a model state vector(s).
    All the old interfaces have been modified to call the new interfaces
    after unpacking the two components of the assim_model type. This is
    purely a modification for ensemble efficiency in the filter. The filter
    can now store the ensembles in an array of size(ens_size, model_size)
    which greatly increases the efficiency under the ifc 7.0 compiler. NOTE:
    the advance_state interface now generates a lot of redundant storage
    which would be a particular problem if it were used to advance ensembles
    in a large model. It should probably have a completely separate implementation
    if anyone is going to use the assim_model_type for advancing ensembles.
    Also removed some diagnostic output that had snuck in, labeled kdr

    Modifications to use of get_obs_set in several subroutines. These were
    calling obs_set_copy which was no longer necessary and was computationally
    extremely expensive, leading filter to scale non-linearly with increasing
    size of observation sets. Results should be identical with improved
    performance.

    Removed a bunch of output files from the seq_obs build.
    lorenz_96 is necessarily chaotic and these showed sensitivity
    to changing types to stuff like:
    real(r8),    parameter ::    delta_t = 0.05        -->>
    real(r8),    parameter ::    delta_t = 0.05_r8
    
    They could be regenerated from the project tag rel-0-0   with
    ../compile_it seq_obs           ;# for example
    ./seq_obs | tee seq_obs.log
