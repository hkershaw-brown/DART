On branch reanalysis
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/reanalysis'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

---------------------
Preserving files that were under review 2019-8.
Some of the files being committed were in the process of being updated 
based on a code review in 2019-8, so they haven't been tested in their current form.
The changes that were made were not propagated back to the svn directory,
so the svn and git versions of some files have diverged, and will need to be 
merged after each of those sets is committed to git.
The main changes are in repack_st_arch.csh.
They're mostly about changing variable names to be more descriptive
and easier to use, improving comments and echoed information.
There are changes to functionality to improve efficiency ("Previous" directories).

> This script was in the process of being updated based on a code review in 2019-8,
  so it hasn't been run as it is.  I finished the update.
! ! But these changes were not propagated back to the svn version,
    so we'll want to merge these at some point.
> Removed PBS directives, since it must run on casper (under slurm).
> Replace local_arch with CESM's DOUT_S_ROOT.
> Improved comments.
> Specify year and month separately for clarity and more flexible use.
  Then define yr_mo.
> Leave the existing yearly files in $project and add months to them there.
> Adapt ncrcat call to that.
> Echo mv_to_campaign.csh commands in case I need to rerun them manually

> Upgrade save_every_Mth_day_restart to handle days of the week.
> Write out cpl history files (the forcing files for CESM's surface components).

                        or rely on the copy in $CASEROOT?
                        More updates may be coming from svn.

                        save because it's what was used (for a different case)?
                        or rely on the copy in its own $CASEROOT 
                        (which we have no plans to archive)?
                  > Added path/file for starting from a single member.
                  > Added lists of CLM history fields to write 
                    (different lists were used in the Reanalysis).

	Untracked	../work/input_rean_2019-10-2.nml
              This is not as updated as input_git.nml.
              input.nml is linked to this (2020-2-5).

	Untracked	cesm2_1/setup_advanced_Test4

	Untracked	../work/input_git.nml -> commit as input.nml
              From 2019-10-8; better organized, more recent choices of var values.
              than what's committed (and was/is called input_git_2019-10-2.nml locally).
              Not a generic input.nml for use by others.
              A more recent version will come from the svn reanalysis DART,
              but that's probably not as well organized or generic (ready to commit)
              as this one.

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
